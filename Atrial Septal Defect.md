# Pathogenesis
Incomplete tissue formation (mostly **[[Septum Secondum]]**; 90%) → **fixed opening in [[Heart#Septa#Interatrial]]** → communication btwn RA and LA

> Also caused by defect of [[Septum Primum]] or [[Sinus Venosus]]; 50% each

If the defect is large → ↑↑ [[Pulmonary Pressure]] so it > [[Blood Pressure|Systemic Pressure]] → reverse direction → **[[Eisenmenger Syndrome]]** → [[Ventricular Hypertrophy#Right]]

# Clinical Manifestation
**Usually asymptomatic** until adulthood (until ~30 y/o) →
- **[[Pulmonary Hypertension]]** -- usually reversible
- **[[Heart Failure]]** and pulmonary vasuclar diseases
- **[[Paradoxical Embolism]]** -- i.e., occur on systemic size rather q pulmonary
- [[Heart Murmur]] -- ↑↑ Q through [[Pulmonary Valve]] and thru the defect

Mortality is **low** and long-term survival is **comparable to general population**
