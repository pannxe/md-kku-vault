## Sites of Haemopoiesis

### Fetus

#### 0-2 mo.

- **Yolk sac**
- AGM
- Placenta
	
> In the first few weeks of gestation the yolk sac is a transient site of haemopoiesis. However, definitive haemopoiesis derives from a population of stem cells first observed on the AGM (aorta‐gonads‐mesonephros) region

#### 2-7 mo.

- **Liver**
- Spleen

> From 6 weeks until 6–7 months of fetal life, the liver and spleen are the major haemopoietic organs and continue to produce blood cells until about 2 weeks after birth. The placenta also contributes to fetal haemopoiesis. 

#### 5-9 mo.

- **Bone marrow**

> The bone marrow is the most important site from 6–7 months of fetal life.
