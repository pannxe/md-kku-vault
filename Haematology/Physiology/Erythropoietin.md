Human erythropoietin gene is encoded in chromosome 7q11-22 (193 amino acids). Recombinant human erythropoietin consists of a 165 amino acid backbone with glycosylation sites

# Secretion
**[[Kidney]]** (90%) and [[Liver]]

# Stimulation
**[[Hypoxia]]** ←
- ↓ [[Red Blood Cell]] / ↓ [[Haemoglobin]]
- ↓ [[O2]] availability

# Physiology
**落 [[Bone Marrow]]** → **↑ [[Erythropoiesis]]** → ↑ O2 carrying capacity

> Also anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour, and neuroprotective 
        
# Clinical Correlation
Recombinant EPO for pt. c **[[Chronic Kidney Disease]]**
