## Haem

- **Haem is made of**
    
    **Porphyrin** + **Fe2+**
    
    > Porphyrin is a cyclic compounds that bind metal ions, e.g., chlorophyll (Mg2+), Cobalamin (Cobalt)

- **Major locations of haem synthesis**
    
    **Erythroid progenitor cells** of the bone marrow and the liver.
    
    > Heme synthesis is, however, occurs in all cells.

- **Metabolic diseases involving haem metabolism**
    
    **Porphyria** — porphyrin builds up in the body; genetic disease

    > Protein that contains a heme prosthetic group.
