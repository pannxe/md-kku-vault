- **Haem iron**
    
    **Haem transporter**
    
- **Non-haem iron**
    
    **Fe2+** (ferrous ion) — **DMT 1**
    
    **Fe3+** (ferric ion) — must be **converted into Fe2+** by **Duodenal Cytochrome B** (**DCYTB** or **Cytochrome B Reductase 1**)
    

### Fate of Absorbed Iron

- **Most absorbed iron bind to**
    
    **Mucosal ferritin**
    
- **Fate of majority of bond iron**
    
    Bind to **ferritin →** **lost** by shedding of epithelial cells
    
- **Fate of minority of bond iron**
    
    Get transported out of endothelial cells, along with some ions that does not bind to mucosal ferritin
    
    - **Fe2+ is transported out via**
        
        **Ferroportin 1**
        
        - **which is inhibited by**
            
            **Hepcidin** — **produced by liver**, negative feedback
            

### Transportation

- **In order to be able to bind to plasma transferrin, Fe2+ must be**
    
    **Converted to Fe3+** 
    
    - **Converted by**
        
        **Hephaestin**
