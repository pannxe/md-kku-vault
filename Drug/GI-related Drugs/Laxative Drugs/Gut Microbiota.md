**Gut microbiota influence several aspect of host health**
- Prevent [[Abdominal Discomfort]]
- Modulate [[Mucosal Immunity]] -> good [[Immune System]]

-> [[Dietary Fiber]] -> Fermentation -> [[Short-chain Fatty Acids]] ([[Acetate]], [[Butyrate]], [[Proplonate]]) ->
- Protection of [[Heart]] and [[Blood Vessels]]
- Prevent [[Atherosclerosis]], [[Obesity]], [[Dyslipidaemia]], [[Insulin Resistance]], etc.
- Incr. [[Immune System]]

# Development with Age
- Diversity incr. c age, peak in adulthood -> high [[Mucosal Immunity]] immunogenicity
- Less stable and diverse in infancy and eldery
> Infants gut microbiota become adult like within 1-2 yrs.

# Clinical Correlation
- **Disrupted microbiota balance** -> [[Dysbiosis]]
