# Tropism
Highest density in **[[Large Intestine]]** > [[Small Intestine]] > [[Stomach]]

# Development with Age
- Diversity incr. c age, peak in adulthood -> high [[Intestinal Mucosal Immunity]] immunogenicity
- Less stable and diverse in infancy and eldery
> Infants gut microbiota become adult like within 1-2 yrs.

# Health Benefits
-> [[Dietary Fiber]] -> Fermentation -> [[Short-chain Fatty Acids]] ([[Acetate]], **[[Butyrate]]**, [[Proplonate]]) ->
- Protection of [[Heart]] and [[Blood Vessels]]
- Prevent [[Atherosclerosis]], [[Obesity]], [[Dyslipidaemia]], [[Insulin Resistance]], etc.
- Incr. [[Immune System]]

# Clinical Correlation
- **Disrupted microbiota balance** -> [[Dysbiosis]]
- **Gut microbiota influence several aspect of host health**
	- Prevent [[Abdominal Discomfort]]
	- **Modulate [[Intestinal Mucosal Immunity]]** -> good development of [[Immune System]]
