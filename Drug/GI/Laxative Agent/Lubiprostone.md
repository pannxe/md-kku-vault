# MoA
Bind to **EP4-receptor** -> incr. Cl- -> **incr. fluid secretion**

> Lubiprostone is a bicyclic fatty acid **derived from [[PGE1]]** that acts by specifically activating ClC-2 chloride channels on the apical aspect of gastrointestinal epithelial cells, producing a chloride-rich fluid secretion. These secretions soften the stool, increase motility, and promote spontaneous bowel movements (SBM).
