**Phytic acid** is a six-fold [dihydrogenphosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate "Phosphate") [ester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester "Ester") of [inositol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inositol "Inositol") (specifically, of the _myo_ [isomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomer "Isomer")), also called **inositol hexakisphosphate** (**IP6**) or **inositol polyphosphate**. At physiological pH, the phosphates are partially ionized, resulting in the **phytate** [anion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anion "Anion").

The (_myo_) phytate anion is a colorless species that has significant nutritional role as the principal storage form of [phosphorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus "Phosphorus") in many [plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant "Plant") [tissues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_tissue "Biological tissue"), especially [bran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bran "Bran") and [seeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed "Seed"). It is also present in many [legumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legume "Legume"), cereals, and grains. Phytic acid and phytate have a strong binding affinity to the [dietary minerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_minerals "Dietary minerals"), [calcium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium "Calcium"), [iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron "Iron"), and [zinc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc "Zinc"), inhibiting their [absorption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine#Absorption "Small intestine") in the small intestine.
