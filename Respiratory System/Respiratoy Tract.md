HResp. tract is organized into 2 portion :
- **Conducting portion**
	- Conduct air s gas exchange
	- [[Nasal Cavity]] → [[Bronchiole#Terminal]] 
- **Respiratory portion**
	- Provide gas exchange
	- [[Bronchiole#Resporatory]] → [[Alveoli]]

# Functions
- **Conducting** air
- **Conditioning** -- [[Goblet Cell]] secrete [[Mucus]]
	- Moistening
	- Warming
	- Particle removal
- **Gas exchange**
- **Smelling** -- [[Olfactory Epithelium]]
- **Immune Defense**

**[[Mucociliary Clearance]]** provide self-cleaning and defense against particles and pathogen

# Conducting Portion
Has charateristic epithelium called **[[Respiratory Epithelium]]** q gradually :
- Transform → [[Simple Cuboidal Epithelium]]
- ↓↓ [[Goblet Cell]]

## Regional Histology
- [[Nose#Histology]]
- [[Pharynx#Histology]]
- [[Larynx#Histology]]
- [[Trachea#Histology]]
- [[Bronchus#Histology]]
- [[Bronchiole#Histology]]

At area q freq. abrasion → [[Stratified Squamous Epithelium#Non-keratinized]]

At [[Superior Concha]] and adjecent [[Nasal Septum]] also found **[[Olfactory Epithelium]]**
