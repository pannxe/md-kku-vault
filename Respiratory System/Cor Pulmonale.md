a.k.a. Right-sided HHD, isolated pulmonary HHD

## Pathophysiology
Disorders of [[Lung]]
- [[Emphysema]]
- **[[Pulmonary Hypertension]]** -- most common

→ **pressure overload** at **[[Heart#Right Ventricle]]** → **[[Ventricular Hypertrophy#Right]]** → (chronic) → [[Heart Failure#Right-sided]] → ↑ volume at RA → **[[Atrial Enlargement#Right]]**

> Enlargement of both RA and RV is characteristic of cor pulmonale

> Note that ico [[Embolism]] (or any acute cause) → might be normal size or only [[Cardiac Dilation]]
