**Severe** → incompatible c intrauterine life → [[Abortion]]

Otherwise, extrauterine survival d nature and severity of disease

# Pathogenesis
**Genetic abnormalities** -- usually sporadic single gene mutation and small chromosome deletion

> Also assoc. [[Turner Syndrome]], [[Patau Syndrome]], [[Edwards Syndrome]], [[Down Syndrome]], etc.

# Left-to-Right Shunts


- **[[Atrial Septal Defect]]** -- 2nd most common (10 %)
- **[[Ventricular Septal Defect]]** -- **most common CHD** (42 %)
- **[[Patent Ductus Arteriosus]]** -- 7 % 

# Right-to-Left Shunts 
- **[[Tetralogy of Fallot]]** -- most common R → L shunt (5 %)
- **[[Transposition of the Great Vessels]]** -- 4%

→ [[Cyanosis#Central]]

 > R → L shunt also caused by [[Persistaent Truncus Arteriosus]], [[Tricuspid Valve Atresia]], and [[Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection]]

# Obstruction 
**[[Aortic Coarctation]]**

→ [[Cyanosis#Peripheral]]

> Also caused by [[Aortic Valve Stenosis]], [[Aortic Valve Atresia]], [[Pulmonary Valve Stenosis]] (8 %), and [[Pulmonary Valve Atresia]]
