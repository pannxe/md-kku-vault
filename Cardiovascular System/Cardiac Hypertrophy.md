**↑ in size** but not much so in number

# Pathophysiology

- ↑ volume and ↑ pressure → **↑ [[Cardiac Wall Tension]]**
- 落 [[β-Adrenergic Receptor]] → proliferation of [[Myocardium]]

→ [[Heart]] chamber become hypertrophic → 
- **Disproportion** to capillary numbers
- ↑ O2 consumption
- ↑ [[Fibrosis]] of interstitium

→ **↑ risk of [[Ischaemic Heart Disease]]** → [[Myocardial Infarction]]

## Exercise-induced
ico. [[Exercise#Aerobic]] → neo-vascularization is ↑ **in proportion** to volume-load hypertrophy → not pathogenic

> ↑ [[SV]] → ↓ [[Heart Rate]] to achive the same [[Cardiac Output]]

Laplace's Law:
$$T = \frac{P\cdot r}{2h}$$
**↑ wall thickness** (h) to ↓ tension;
- Pressure ↑↑ → concentric -- ↓ r
- Volume ↑↑ → eccentric -- ↑ r → ↑ volume capability ([[Cardiac Dilation]])
