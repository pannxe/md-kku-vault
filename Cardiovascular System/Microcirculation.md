# Structure

- **[[Arterioles]]** -- featuring [[Smooth Muscle]]
- [[Metarterioles]] -- connect arterioles → venules
- [[Pre-capillary Sphincter]] -- control flow **s [[Autonomic NS]]**, i.e., using -crimes
- **[[Capillaries]]** -- site of exchange
- **[[Venules]]** -- recieve blood from capillary

# Function
- **Transport nutrients** to and **remove waste** from cells
- Allow **passage of [[Leukocytes]]**
- Principal site of **[[SVR]]** -- arterioles
- Capacitance area → blood reservoir

# Features
- **↓ velocosity** of [[Blood]]
- **↑↑↑ surface area**
- **↓ velocity** of blood flow -- esp. post-capillary venules

→ **↑↑↑ exchange rate**

> See : [[Haemodynamic]]

# Exchange
$$NFP = \Delta P_{c \rightarrow i} - \Delta \Pi_{c \rightarrow i}$$
Exchange of substance is governed by 2 pairs of Starling Forces between [[Capillaries]] (c) and [[Interstitial Fluid]] (i) :
- [[Colloid Osmotic Pressure]] (Π)
- [[Hydrostatic Pressure]] (P)

$$ Filtration = k \times NFP $$
NFP is net filtration pressure; NFP is modified by filtration coefficcient of that particular [[Capillaries]]

Normally ΔΠ remains constant along capillary bed but **ΔP ↓ over distants** → **filtration near arteriole** and **absorbtion near vanule**

Filtration per day is ~20 L but reabsorption is ~17L → **remaining 3 L is drained into [[Lymphatic System]]**

> Thus [[Lymphatic System]] control Πi via control of IF volume

# Clinical Correlation
**[[Oedema]]** -- filtration >> reabsorption (NFP > 15-17 mmHg) → ↑↑ [[Interstitial Fluid]]

> There exists safe-range bc 
> - Tissue has normally slightly
> - Adaptability of lymphatic system
> - Wash down of proteins from interstitium q NFP ~7 mmHg → ↓ NFP
