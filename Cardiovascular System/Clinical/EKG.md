# Waves
Waves are caused only q voltage changes and NOT q fully sustain
## P-wave
Casued by **depolarization** a **atiral** contraciton

## QRS-complex
Caused by **depolarization** a **ventricle** contraction

## T-wave
Caused by **ventricle recover** from depolarization (**repolarization**)

> Atrial repolarization wave is obscured by QRS-complex in normal EKG 

# Intervals
## P-Q Interval
- A time btwn **beginning of P-wave → beginning of Q-wave** -- i.e., **time btwn atrial** and **ventricle contraction**
- Assoc. **conduction speed of [[AV Bundle]]** -- ↑ speed → ↓ time → ↓ interval lenght

> Assoc. [[Autonomic NS]] control of [[Heart Rate]]

## P-R Interval
Somewhat interchangable c P-Q interval if Q wave is absent

## Q-T Interval
A time btwn **beginning of Q-wave** (or R-wave) → **end of T-wave** -- i.e., time of ventricular contraction

## T-T Interval
Time btwn T-wave to T-wave → reflex **[[Heart Rate]]**

# Standard Calibration
- X-axis -- **25 mm/sec** → each dark line (**0.5 mm**) = **0.2 sec**
- Y-axis -- **1 mV/cm**

# Standard Bipolar Limb Leads

- Cardiac impulse travel from ventricle septum to inside surfaces
- Depolarization make outside of muscle fiber negative

→ electronegativity on septum and electropositivity on other wall → negative charge travel through out the body from base of heart (-) to apex (+)

EKG is recorded using 2 electrodes on different sides of heart
