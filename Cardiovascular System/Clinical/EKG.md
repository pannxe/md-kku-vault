# Waves
Waves are caused only q voltage changes and NOT q fully sustain
## P-wave
Casued by **depolarization** a **atiral** contraciton
> CC : 
> - Widen P-wave ← [[Atrial Enlargement#Left]]
> - Tall P-wave ← [[Atrial Enlargement#Right]]

## QRS-complex
Caused by **depolarization** a **ventricle** contraction
> CC:
> - ↓ amplitude ← [[Cardiomyopathy]], [[Pericardial Effusion]]
> - ↑ amplitude ← [[Ventricular Hypertrophy]]
> - Widen QRS ← branch blockage, [[Ventricular Hypertrophy]]

## T-wave
Caused by **ventricle recover** from depolarization (**repolarization**)

> Atrial repolarization wave is obscured by QRS-complex in normal EKG 

> CC:
> - Tall peak ← [[Hyperkalaemia]]
> - Flat ← [[Hypokalaemia]]
> - Inverted [[Ischaemia]]

# Intervals
## P-Q Interval
- A time btwn **beginning of P-wave → beginning of Q-wave** -- i.e., **time btwn atrial** and **ventricle contraction**
- Assoc. **conduction speed of [[AV Bundle]]** -- ↑ speed → ↓ time → ↓ interval lenght

> Assoc. [[Autonomic NS]] control of [[Heart Rate]]

## P-R Interval
Somewhat interchangable c P-Q interval if Q wave is absent

## Q-T Interval
A time btwn **beginning of Q-wave** (or R-wave) → **end of T-wave** -- i.e., time of ventricular contraction

## T-T Interval
Time btwn T-wave to T-wave → reflex **[[Heart Rate]]**

# Standard Calibration
- X-axis -- **25 mm/sec** → each dark line (**0.5 mm**) = **0.2 sec**
- Y-axis -- **1 mV/cm**

EKG can be measured by different types of leads
- Frontal Plane →
	- Standard Bipolar Limb Leads
	- Augmented (Unipolar) Limb Leads
- Horizontal Plane → Precordial Leads

# Standard Bipolar Limb Leads

![[Pasted image 20220615181157.png]]

Is a record **in frontal plane**
- Cardiac impulse travel from ventricle septum to inside surfaces
- Depolarization make outside of muscle fiber negative

→ electronegativity on septum and electropositivity on other wall → negative charge travel through out the body from base of heart (-) to apex (+)

EKG is recorded using 2 electrodes on different sides of heart

## Lead I
- (+) -- Lt. arm
- (-) -- Rt. arm

## Lead II
- (+) -- Lt. leg
- (-) -- Rt. arm

## Lead III
- (+) -- Lt. leg
- (-) -- Lt. arm

## Einthoven's Law
Electrical vector of bipolar limb lead : $I + III = II$ is **always true in normal EKG**

## Clinical Correlation
- q dx **condition vs time** (e.g., [[Arrhythmia]]) -- **does not matter that much** what lead to use ← similar shape of wave
- But q dx **condition assoc. damage to structure** -- **DOES matter a lot** ← abnormality in [[Heart#Conducting System]] or contraction can change pattern in some leads but not the others

## Normal

# Augemented Limb Leads
Is a **unipolar** recording in **frontal plane** -- using 3 limbs, 2 are connected to resistances → (-) terminal; the other one to (+) :
- Rt. arm → **aVR** lead
- Lt. arm → **aVL** lead
- Lt. leg → **aVF** lead

They are similar to standard bipolar limb leads except **aVR is inverted** (electrical vector travel AWAY from + electrode)

# Precordial Leads

![[Pasted image 20220615211944.png]]

6x (+) are placed on **anterior chest wall** and (-) c resistances on rt. arm, lt. arm, and lt. leg
- V1 and V2 -- **4th ICS**; **Rt.** and **Lt**. **parasternal border** → near base of heart (direction of electronegativity) → **QRS negative**
- V3 btwn V2 and V4
- V4, V5, and V6 -- **5th ICS**; Lt. MCL, AAL, and MAL → near apex (direction of electropositivity) → **QRS positive** 

# NSR
Normal Sinus Rhythm :
- Normal P-wave morphology c consistant rate (60-100 bpm)
- Constant QRS complex follow P wave
- Constant RR interval
