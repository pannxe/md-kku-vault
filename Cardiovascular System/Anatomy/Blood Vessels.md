Blood vessels consists of 3 layer (*tunicae*)

![[Pasted image 20220622020548.png]]

## Tunica Intima
Innermost layer c [[Simple Squamous Epithelium]] endothelium and loose CNT sub-endothelium

**Internal elastic lamina** -- sheet of [[Elastic Fiber]], **prominent in 
 [[Arteries]]**

## Tunica Media
Middle layer c **[[Smooth Muscle]] circulary arrenged**
> except in elastic arteries

Also contain some CNT and elastic lamina

> CC : **[[Marfan Syndrome]]** -- abnormal elastic lamina

## Tunica Adventitia
Outermost layer, loose CNT
- Invagination of **[[Vasa Vasorum]]**
- May contains [[Smooth Muscle]] in larger vessles

Helps anchor vessel to other tissues

---

- Tunica adventitia is the thickest layer in [[Veins]] but tunica media for [[Arteries]]
- Overall, veins ↓ elastic and ↓ thickness q arteries → tends to collapse q cut

> For specific types see [[Arteries]], [[Arterioles]], [[Metarterioles]], [[Veins]], [[Venules]] and [[Capillaries]]
