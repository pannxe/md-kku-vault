# Structure

Vascular system consists of
- [[Arterial System]] -- distribution system
- [[Microcirculation]] -- diffusion to and from tissues
- [[Venous System]] -- correcting system

Key differences are **wall thickness** and **lumen diameter** 

# Distensibility

$$ D_v = \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta P \times V_0}$$
Vessels are elastic -- i.e., distensible, esp. [[Veins]] (8x arteries)

Slight ↑ in venous pressure → ↑ blood storage ~0.5-1 L

# Elasticity

Ability to **return to normal shape** p distortion

# Compliance

$$ C_v = \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta P} = D_v\times V$$
a.k.a. vascular capacitance -- ability to ↑ volume q ↑ pressure; [[Venous System]] > [[Arterial System]] (24x)

→ blood reservoir → **↓ pressure oscillation** (**[[Windkessel Model]]**)

## Clinical Correlation
- ↑ age → [[Collagen]] deposition replace [[Elastin]] → ↓ compliance → ↓ [[Windkessel Model]] → **compensatory ↑ [[Blood Pressure#Systolic]]** 
- **Velocity of [[Pulse Wave]]** is used to measure arterial compliance
