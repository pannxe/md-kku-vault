[[Venous System]] has ↓↓ resistance → require only small pressure to drive [[Blood]] to [[Heart#Right Atrium]]

> [[Veins]] at [[Arms]] and [[Legs]] contains valves → 1-way passage of blood

# Determinants
- Contraction of venous smooth muscle ←
	- [[Sympathetic NS]]
	- [[Hormones]] that 落 [[Vasoconstriction]]
- **[[Skeletal Muscle Pump]]**
- **[[Respiratory Pump]]**

Ultimately ↑ [[Venous Return]] → **↑ [[EDV]]** → **↑ [[SV]]**

# Central
Venous pressure at [[Heart#Right Atrium]] = **0 mmHg**.

CVP is controlled by
- Ability of [[Heart]] to pump blood to [[Lung]]
- Tendency of blood direction

# Head Region
Gravity → ↓ P (up to -10 mmHg) → **neck veins collapse completely** → pressure remains 0 mmHg → cranial venous pressure build up to > 0 mmHg → neck veins re-open → blood flow down to [[Heart]] → reclose q tendency reversed  

> [[Dural Sinuses]] have rigid wall → **cannot collapse** → maintain negative pressure

# Clinical Correlation
- **↑ CVP**
	- **[[Heart Failure]]** -- back-pressure from RA
	- p [[Blood Transfusion]]
- **↓ CVP**
	- ↑ works of heart pump
	- ↓↓↓ [[Blood]] flow to peripheral vessels ← possibly **haemorrhage**

> ↑↑↑ compliance of vein → small pressure change q early stage of HF

- Large [[Veins]] can **collapse** → ↑ resistance → ↑ CVP esp. **q lying down**
- [[Pregnancy]], [[Ascites]], tumors, etc. → ↑↑ [[Intrathoracic Pressure]] → ↓↓ blood flow from [[Legs]] →
