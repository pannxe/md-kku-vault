**Excitation-Contraction Coupling (E-C coupling; ECC)** -- a process which [[Electrical Activity of Heart]] causes contraction ([[Heart#Biological Pump]])

# Mechanism of Action

## Contraction
AP spreads to [[T Tubule]] → 落 [[Sodium Channel]] → ↑ potential →
- **落 [[Calcium Channel#L-type]]** on sarcolemma → ↑ [[Calcium]] influx → 落 [[RyR]] -- a.k.a. **Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR)**
- Directly 落 [[RyR]] → **Ca released from SR**
→ **↑ cytosolic Ca2+** → **落 Cross-bridge formation** → **contraction**

> Similar to [[Skeletal Muscle]] but c Ca2+ influx from ECF; Less developed SR q skeletal muscle → Ca2+ form SR alone is not enough 

## Relaxation
- The end of [[Electrical Activity of Heart#Action Potential of Non-pacemaker Cell#Phase 3 -- Rapid Repolarization]] → [[Calcium Channel#L-type]] and [[RyR]] closed → ** Ca2+ influx into cytosol**
- Ca2+ pumped back → SR via [[SERCA2]]
- Ca2+ is pumped out of cell via [[Na-Ca Exchanger]]

→ **↓↓↓ cytosolic [[Calcium]]** → **relaxation**
