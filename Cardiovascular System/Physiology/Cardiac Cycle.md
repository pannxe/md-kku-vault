Events q occur from one heartbeat to the next. Each cycle is initiated by [[SA Node]].

# Phases

## Atrial Systole
**Atrial contraction** and **blood forced to ventricles** 
> - [[Heart Valves#Semilunar Valves]] already closed due to ↓ ventricular pressure
> - [[Heart Valves#AV Valves]] already opened

## Isovolumetric Ventricular Contraction
**Ventricles contract** → ↑ ventricular pressure →
- ↑ q atrial → **AV valves close**
- Still ↓ q arterial → **semilunar valves still close**

→ Blood cannot escape ventricles → **no volume change** but **pressure ↑ progressively**

> - [[Heart Sound#S1]] produced
> - Blood volume reaches [[EDV]]

## Ventricular Ejection
**Ventricular pressure now ↑ q arterial** → **semilunar valves open** → blood flow out of ventricles → pressure progressively ↓

## Isovolumetric Ventricular Relaxation
**Ventricles relax** and ↓ blood volume → ↓ ventricular pressure → 
- ↓ q arterial → **semilunar valves close**
- Still ↑ q atria → AV valves still close

→ Blood cannot flow into ventricles → **no volume change** but **pressure ↓↓ progressively** 

> - [[Heart Sound#S2]] produced
> - Blood volume reaches [[ESV]]

# Ventricular Filling
**Ventricular pressure now ↓ q atrial** → **AV valves open** → blood flow into ventricles
> Then the process repeats

### Ventricular Diastole
