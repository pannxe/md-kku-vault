**Quantity of [[Blood]] at pass thru a given point at a given time** -- described by Ohm's Law
$$F = \frac{\Delta P}{R}$$
(F = flow (usually L/min), P = pressure, R = resistant)

Blood is viscose, non-newtonian fluid (η change q shear rate) → center point flow faster q edge → parabolic shape flow

# Resistance
Descirbed by Poiseuille's Law
$$F = \frac{\Delta P \pi r^4}{8\eta l}$$
(l = length of vessel, r = radius)

q combine c Ohm's law :
$$R=\frac{8 \eta l}{\pi r^4}$$

Since η and l changes are minimal → **main determinant of R is r**

> Viscosity is defined as follow :
$$\eta = \frac{F/A}{dv/dx}$$
(F/A is shear force; dv/dx is shear rate)

# Velocity of Blood Flow
$$ F = vA$$
Flow (F) is constant at a given time → **v depends on A**

Total x-sectional area progressively ↑ → max at [[Capillaries]] → progressively ↓ → min at vein
- Thus blood is **fastest at arteries** → **slowest at capillaries**
- Energy loss → **v_artery > v_vein** and **v_arterio > v_venule**

## Total Energy
Using Bernoulli' equation :
$$P_1 + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_1^2 + \rho g h_1 = P_2 + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_2^2 + \rho g h_2$$
- **↑ v** → **↓ P** (at the same level)
- **↑ h → ↓ P**

(assume ρ change very little)
