# Action Potential of Non-pacemaker Cell
AP in [[Heart|Ventricles]] rises from **-85 mV â†’ +20 mV**; **lasts ~200 ms** -- *plateau* a. repolarization

AP in [[Cardiac Muscle]] is caused by opening of **2 types of channel** (vs. [[Skeletal Muscle]] only [[Sodium Channel#Fast Type]]); which are :
- [[Sodium Channel#Fast Type]]
- **[[Calcium Channel#L-type]]**
