# Action Potential of Non-pacemaker Cell

AP in [[Heart|Ventricles]] rises from **-85 mV → +20 mV**; **lasts ~200 ms** -- longer q [[Skeletal Muscle]]

AP in [[Cardiac Muscle]] is caused by opening of **2 types of channel** (vs. Skeletal Muscle -- only [[Sodium Channel#Fast Type]]); which are :
- [[Sodium Channel]]
- **[[Calcium Channel#L-type]]** -- slower q fast Na channel to open and remains open for longer

## Phase 0 -- Depolarization
**[[Sodium Channel#Fast Type]] open** → **depolarization** to +20 mV

## Phase 1 -- Initial Repolarization
- **[[Sodium Channel]] close**
- [[Potassium]] leave via [[Potassium Channel]]

→ Slight voltage drop to ~+10 mV

## Phase 2 -- Plateau
- **[[Calcium Channel#L-type]] open** → **[[Calcium]]** and [[Sodium]] keep enter cardiac muscle fibers
- **[[Potassium Channel]] close** → ↓↓ efflux of positive charges

Ion in/out equal out → **Prolonged depolarization**

> Ca2+ that entered cell also contrib to contraction, unlike Skeletal muscle where only Ca2+ from SR contrib to contraction
> 

## Phase 3 -- Rapid Repolarization
- **[[Calcium Channel#L-type]] close** → ↓↓ Na+ and Ca2+ influx 
- **[[Potassium Channel]] re-open** → ↑↑ K+ efflux 

→ ↓↓ Voltage → **Repolarization**

## Phase 4 -- Resting Membrane Potential
Avg. at -80 - -90 mV

## Refactory Period
- ARP -- phase 0-2
- RRP -- phase 3

# Action Potential of Pacemaker Cell

## Phase 0 -- Depolarization
Resting membrane potential of pacemaker cells is **~55 mV** → many [[Sodium Channel#m-gate]] has already closed → **rely mainly on [[Calcium Channel#L-type]]** to cause AP → **[[SA Node]] is slower** to develop and repolarize AP q [[Heart|Ventricles]] 

## Phase 3 -- Hyperpolarization

- [[Calcium Channel#L-type]] close within 100-150 ms p opening 
- [[Potassium Channel]] open → [[Potassium]] efflux

→ ↓↓ potential

## Phase 4 -- Prepotential
**↑↑ [[Sodium]] conc. in ECF** and **many already openned [[Sodium Channel]]** → inward leaking of Na (*Funny currents*) → **slow rising of RMP** until reached threshold again

> [[Potassium Channel]] progressively closed p phase 3 

## Refactory Period
- ARP -- phase 0
- RRP -- phase 3 - early 4
