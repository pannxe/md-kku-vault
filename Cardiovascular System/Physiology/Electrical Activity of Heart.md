# Action Potential of Non-pacemaker Cell
AP in [[Heart|Ventricles]] rises from **-85 mV → +20 mV**; **lasts ~200 ms** -- *plateau* a. repolarization

AP in [[Cardiac Muscle]] is caused by opening of **2 types of channel** (vs. [[Skeletal Muscle]] only [[Sodium Channel#Fast Type]]); which are :
- [[Sodium Channel#Fast Type]]
- **[[Calcium Channel#L-type]]** -- slower q fast Na channel to open and remain open for longer

Ca2+ and Na+ keep influx into cardiac muscle fiber → prolonged depolarization → *plateau (Phase II)*
> Ca2+ that entered cell also contrib to contraction, unlike Skeletal muscle where only Ca2+ from SR contrib to contraction
> 

Immediately p AP, permeability of cardiac muscle for [[Potassium]] ↓↓↓ (~5x) → ↓ efflux of positive charges → 
