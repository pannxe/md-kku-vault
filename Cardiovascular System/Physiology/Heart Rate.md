# Control
## Internal Phase
Consider 3 self-excitory tissues in heart:
- Intrinsic rate of **[[SA Node]] is ~70-80 Hz**
- Intrinsic rate of [[AV Node]] is ~40-60 Hz
- Intrinsic rate of [[Purkinje Fibers]] is ~15-40 Hz

**↑ rate of [[SA Node]]** → q discharge also **force discharge** [[AV Node]] and [[Purkinje Fibers]] → [[SA Node]] being the main determinance

## Neural Control

[[Sympathetic NS]] → ↑ opening of [[Funny Channel]] and [[Calcium Channel#T-type]] → ↑↑ [[Sodium]] and [[Calcium]] influx
- **↑ slope** of **pre-poteintial phase** → ↓ time btwn pulse → ↑ HR
- **↑ excitibility of [[AV Bundle]]**

→ ↑ HR

[[Parasympathetic NS]] → ↑ opening of [[Potassium Channel]], ↓ [[Funny Channel]], ↓ [[Calcium Channel#T-type]] →
- **↓ slope** of prepoteintial phase → take longer to reach AP 
- **↓ excitibility of [[AV Bundle]]**

→ ↓ [[Heart Rate]] (potentially stop SA node → [[Ventricular Escape]])

## Hormonal Control
- **[[Catecholamines]]** -- **↑ AP freq. at [[SA Node]]** (similar to Sympathetic NS)
- **[[Thyroid Hormones]]** -- **↑ pre-potential slope** and **↑ rate of repolarization** 

→ **↑ HR**
