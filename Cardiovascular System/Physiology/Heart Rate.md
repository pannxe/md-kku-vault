# Control
## Internal Phase
Consider 3 self-excitory tissues in heart:
- Intrinsic rate of **[[SA Node]] is ~70-80 Hz**
- Intrinsic rate of [[AV Node]] is ~40-60 Hz
- Intrinsic rate of [[Purkinje Fibers]] is ~15-40 Hz

**↑ rate of [[SA Node]]** → q discharge also **force discharge** [[AV Node]] and [[Purkinje Fibers]] → [[SA Node]] being the main determinance of [[Heart Rate]]

## External Control 
[[Sympathetic NS]] → all parts of [[Heart]] (esp. ventricles)
- **↑ slope** of prepoteintial phase → ↓ time btwn pulse → ↑ HR
- **↑ excitibility of [[AV Bundle]]**
- **↑↑↑ force of contraction** (all part of heart)

[[Parasympathetic NS]] → [[SA Node]], [[AV Node]], and atria (few)
- **↓ slope** of prepoteintial phase → take longer to reach AP 
- **↓ excitibility of [[AV Bundle]]**
→ ↓ [[Heart Rate]] (potentially stop SA node → [[Ventricular Escape]])
