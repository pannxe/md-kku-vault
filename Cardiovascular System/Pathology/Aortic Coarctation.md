# Forms
## Infantile
Proximal to [[Patent Ductus Arteriosus]]

## Adult
Ridge-like infold of [[Aorta]] opposite to [[Ligamentum Arteriosum]]

# Pathogenesis
d **severity of stenosis** and presence of **[[Patent Ductus Arteriosus]]**

c PDA -- **de-O2 blood mixed** → **[[Cyanosis]]** on the **lower half** of the body (site of mixure is distal to [[Aorta#Arch]]) 
> Need Sx to remove DA

s PDA
- back pressure to [[Aorta#Arch]] → **[[Hypertension]]** in **upper half** of the body
- ↓ blood flow to [[Aorta#Thoracic]] → [[Hypotension]] and weak [[Pulse Pressure]] in the **lower half**
- General manifestation of ↓ blood supply

Stenosis → turbulence flow → ↑ risk of **[[Atherosclerosis]]**

> Could be asymptomatic as well
