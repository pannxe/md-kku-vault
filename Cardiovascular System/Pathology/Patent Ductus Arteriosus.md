# Pathogenesis
[[Hypoxia]] → **failure of closure of [[Ductus Arteriosus]]** (normally close within 2 days p birth) → blood flow from **[[Aorta]]** to **[[Pulmonary Artery]]**

> Thus [[Congenital Heart Disease]] that cause hypoxia is often assoc. PDA e.g., **[[Ventricular Septal Defect]]**

As it is L → R in nature : 
- Small shunt -- **asymptomatic** and no effect on child development
- **Large shunt** -- **[[Pulmonary Hypertension]]** → reversal of shunt
