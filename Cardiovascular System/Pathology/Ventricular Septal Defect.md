Most common [[Congenital Heart Disease]]

# Pathogenesis
**Incomplete [[Heart#Septa#Interventricular]]** (esp. **membranous part**; 90%) formation → blood from from LV → RV → **[[Ventricular Hypertrophy#Right]]**

> Defect at conus arteriosus and muscular part is rarer; defect at muscular part can close sponteneously

if the defect is large -- **[[Pulmonary Hypertension]]** → reversal of shunt → [[Cyanosis]] → early death

> Sx correction is needed in large VSD; if small → wait until pass infancy in hope of sponteneous closure
