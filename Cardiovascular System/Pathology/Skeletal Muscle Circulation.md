At rest 3-10 mL/min

# Factors

![[Pasted image 20220622055336.png]]

**[[Exercise#Aerobic]]** → **↑ 50x**; q contraction of [[Skeletal Muscle]] → ↓↓ blood flow and ↑↑ q relaxation → **fluctuation**

p exercise (both phasic and sustained) → **[[Hyperaemia#Active]]**

# Control
## Metabolic
- ↑ load → ↑ metabolites from [[Skeletal Muscle]] → **[[Vasodilation]]** → ↑ blood flow

## Neural Control
**[[Sympathetic NS]]** → [[Vasoconstriction]] but metabolic control of active muscle overcome → **shunt blood to active muscle**

Sympathetic also provide vasomotor tone

q ↓↓ [[Blood Pressure]] → ↓ flow → shunt to more important organ
