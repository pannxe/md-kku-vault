# Pathogenesis

![[Pasted image 20220627205444.png]]

Blood splays tunica media of aorta apart → form blood-filled channel

# Risk Factor
- **Younger pts** -- assoc. CNT diseases (e.g., **[[Marfan Syndrome]]**)
- Older pts, esp. **Male 40-60 y/o** -- assoc. **[[Hypertension]]**

> Majority are from HTN; as CNT diseases are rare in general

# Consequences

d types, i.e., location of lesion :

## Type A
i.e., **Proximal lesion** -- at **[[Aorta#Ascending]]** c/s descending part → ↓ blood flow to [[Cerebral Circulation]] → **NS involvement**

## Type B
i.e., **Distal lesion** -- **beyond [[Subclavian Artery]]**
> lesion p [[Aorta#Arch]] → s NS involvement
