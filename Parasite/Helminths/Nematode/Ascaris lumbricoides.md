- Common name : Giant roundworm, พยาธิไส้เดือน
- Maybe it's [[Ascaris suum]] (zoonosis)

# Epidemiology
- **Commonly coinfects with [[Trichuris trichiura]]** <- similar mode of transmission
- High prevalence in tropical area -> **Southern Thailand**
> Moist, high rain, warm, sheddy etc.

# Risk Factor
- **Poor sanitation**
- **Poor socioecomomic**
- **[[PICA]]** pt.
- **Children**, obviously

# Transmission
- **Soil-borned** or contaminated water and food <- ingestion of **eggs with L3 larva in it** faecal-oral route 
- Larva migrate to [[Lung]] -> coughed up and re-enter [[Small Intestine]]
- Egg are very resistant to dry and hot environment

# Pathogenesis
- Larva migration to lung -> [[Loeffler Syndrome]]
- **Adult lives in [[Small Intestine]]** -> **[[Intestinal Obstruction]]**
- May migrate to 
	- [[Bile Duct]] -> **[[Biliary Obstruction]]**
	- [[Pancreas]] -> [[Pancreatitis]]
	- [[Skin]] (rare) -> waste products -> chronic [[Urticaria]]

# Clinical Manifestation
## Light Infection
Frequently **asymptomatic**. In children may cause :
- [[Anorexia]]
- [[Abdominal Pain]], [[Abdominal Distention]]
- [[Diarrhoea]] -> [[Malnutrition]] -> [[Weight Loss]] -> [[Failure to Thrive]]
- [[Weakness]]

# Heavy Infection
- **[[Intestinal Obstruction]]** -- mostly at distal [[Ileum]]
	- Tramline appearance in [[Radiology]]
- **[[UGI Bleeding]]** -> [[Intestinal Perforation]]
- [[Intussusception]], [[Volvulus]]
- [[Peritonitis]]

# Diagnosis
- **Identification of eggs in stool** <- [[FECT]], [[Kato-Katz Technique]], or simple smear
- Molecular and serological are not widely used clinically
> Accidentally found during colonoscopy or sequelle from gut obstruction

# Treatment
- **Surgery** -> remove ico. [[Intestinal Obstruction]] or [[Biliary Obstruction]]
- **[[Albendazole]]**
