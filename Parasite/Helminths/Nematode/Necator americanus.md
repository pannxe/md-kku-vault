# Epidemiology
Southern China, **Southeeast Asia**, Americas, and Africa
> Co-endermic with [[Ancyclostoma ceylanicum]]

# Morphology
- **A pair** of **cutting plate**
- **S-shaped body**
> See [[Ancyclostoma duodenale]] for differences

# Life Cycle
**L3 larva** on **vegetation** -> **prenetrate skin** -> migrate to [[Lung]] -> coughed-up and enter [[Small Intestine]] -> egg passed in faeces

# Pathogenesis
## Larve
- Entry -> **Ground itch** (Pruritic, erythematous [[Rash]])
- Secretions -> **[[Allergy]]** -> [[Dermatitis]] in repeteated infection
- Larva in [[Lung]] -> **[[Wakana Disease]]**

## Adult
- Movement + anit-coagulating secretion -> **leakage around the attachment site** -> chronic blood loss -> **iron-dificiency [[Anaemia]]** -> poor birth outcome
	> [[Ancyclostoma duodenale]] causes 10x more blood loss

- **Protein-loss** in moderate-heavy infection -> [[Hypoalbuminaemia]], [[Anasarca]], [[Ascites]] -> [[Abdominal Distention]]

# Diagnosis
Clue of **iron deficiency [[Anaemia]]** -> perform stool exam (**[[FECT]]**) -> **egg or L3 larva in faeces**.

# Treatment
- **[[Albendazole]]**
- **[[Mebendazole]]**
- [[Pyrantel]]
> [[Ivermectin]] is not effective in GI stage but used in [[Cutaneous Larva Migrans]]

# Prevention and Control
- **Ware shoes**
- Other standard shits of soil-borne parasite
- Vaccine is in clinical trial
- WASH strategies
