# Epidemiology
- Tempered zone > tropical zone
- **Prevalence 10%** regardless of socioeconomy -> **up to 50% in children**

# Risk Factor
- Crowded area -- proson, nursery, kindergarten, etc.
- Neglected elderly
- Unwashed cloths

# Morphology
- Expansion of cuticula -> **cephalic alae**

# Life Cycle
- Anal-oral route (NOT faecal-oral)
- Egg can survive up to 2 wks in cold and humid area

# Transmission
- **[[Anus]] -> [[Mouth]]** -- via hand, [[Sexual Intercourse]]
- **Airborne** - inhalation of eggs -> swollen to [[Large Intestine]]
- Egg hatch -> **retromigrate** to [[Large Intestine]]

# Pathogenesis and Clinical Manifestation
- Usually **asymptomatic** or **mild**
- Female claw and lay egg at [[Anus]] during nighttime ->
	- [[Allergic Reaction]] -> **[[Pruritus Ani]]** -> scratching -> **Bacterial Infection**
	- **[[Sleep Disturbance]]** -> [[Agitation]], [[Anorexia]] -> [[Weight Loss]], [[Anal Pain]]
- [[Appendicitis]] and [[Eosinophilic Colitis]]
- Extraintestinial symptoms

# Diagnosis
- Young age, pre-schooler
- Perianal itching
- **[[Scotch Tape Technique]] -> Egg**
> Stool exam is not useful (eggs do not passed via faece )
- No serological test available as of now

# Treatment
## Specific
Typical Anti-nematode + **Re-treatment after 2 wks.** -> eliminate egg
- **[[Albendazole]]**
- [[Mebendazole]]
- [[Pyrantel]]
> Caution for very young pt -> weight risk and benefit

## Supportive
- [[Corticosteroid]] cream at perianal -> reduce itch

# Prevention
- **Mass treatment**
- Proper hygiene
- Paental education
