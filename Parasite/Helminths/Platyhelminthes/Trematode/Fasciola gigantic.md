# Geographic Distribution
**Tropical zone** -- including Thailand

# Life Cycle
Typical of trematode.
- IH 1 -- [[Fresh Water Snail]]
- IH 2 -- [[Aquatic Plant]]

**Metacercaria** -- infective stage -> contaminate in **[[Aquatic Plant]]** -> Excyst in [[Duodenum]] -> migrate out of GI tract -> [[Abdominal Wall]] and [[Diaphragm]] -> encapsulate and develop in [[Liver]]

# Clinical Manifestation
## Acute
**Juvenile worm migration** -> tissure destruction -> inflammation
- [[Fever]]
- [[Nausea and Vomitting]]
- [[Abdominal Pain]]
- [[Internal Bleeding]]
- [[Allergies]]
- **[[Extrahepatic Fascioliasis]]**

## Chronic
From adult worm in the liver
- [[Cholangitis]]
- **[[Biliary Obstruction]]** <- large size of the parasite
	- [[Cholecystitis]]
	- [[Gallstone]]
	- [[Pancreatitis]]
- **[[Hepatic Fibrosis]]**
	- **[[Jaundice]]**
- [[Anaemia]]

# Diagnosis
- **Egg detection in faeces** -- either direct smear or concentration technique (**[[FECT]]** (preferred) and [[Kato-Katz Technique]]) 
- Immunological and molecular technique -- esp. for [[Extrahepatic Fascioliasis]]

## False Positive
**Consumption of infected liver** -> egg in stool but pt. does not get infected.

## False Negative
- **Light infection**
- **Cross-reaction** with other common parasite (e.g. [[Paragonimus spp.]]) and persistant Ab present

# Treatment
**[[Triclabendazole]]**
> [[Praziquantel]] is no effective

# Prevention
Regular screening, cooked food, eliminate snail host, etc.
