# Geographical Distribution
**Lower Mekong Basin**
> Thailand, Lao, Southern Vietnam, Myanmar

# Morphology
- **Deep lobed testis** vs. 
	- [[Opisthorchis fellineus]] -- shallow lobed
	- [[Clonorchis sinensis]] -- branched
- **Eggs are similar amongest liver fluke**
	- Caps
	- Tail notch
	- Melon-appearance

# Life Cycle
- Infective stage is **Metacercaria**
- Dx stage is **Egg**

Embryonated egg passed c faeces -> water -> ingested via [[Fresh Water Snail]] (IH 1) -> ingested by [[Cyprinid]] Fish (IH 2) -> Human

# Transmission
**Food-borne** -- **uncooked fish** -> ingestion of metacaercaria
> Koipla, plasom, plara that had not been fermented long enough

# Pathology
- Protein secreted by the parasite -> **DNA damage**
- Sucker -> Mechanical damage -> Inflammation -> **[[Periductal Fibrosis]]** -> Chronic -> **[[Cholangiocarcinoma]]** -> Metastasis
- Immune reponds -> Free radical + [[Nitrosamine]] -> **DAN damage**
- [[Biliary Obstruction]] -> [[Gallbladder Hydrops]]

## Carcinogenicity
Based on [[IARC Monogram]], *O. viverini* is **Group I Carcinogen** -> [[Cholangiocarcinoma]]
