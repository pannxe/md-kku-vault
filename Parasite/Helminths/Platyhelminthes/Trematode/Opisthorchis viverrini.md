# Geographical Distribution
**Lower Mekong Basin**
> Thailand, Lao, Southern Vietnam, Myanmar

# Morphology
- **Deep lobed testis** vs. 
	- [[Opisthorchis fellineus]] -- shallow lobed
	- [[Clonorchis sinensis]] -- branched
- **Eggs are similar amongest liver fluke**
	- Caps
	- Tail notch
	- Melon-appearance

# Life Cycle
- Infective stage -- **metacercaria**
- Dx stage -- **egg**
- RHs -- **cats**, **dogs**

Embryonated egg passed c faeces -> water -> ingested via [[Fresh Water Snail]] (IH 1) -> ingested by **[[Cyprinid]] Fish** (IH 2) -> Human

# Transmission
**Food-borne** -- **uncooked fish** -> ingestion of metacaercaria
> Koipla, plasom, plara that had not been fermented long enough

# Pathology
- Protein secreted by the parasite -> **DNA damage**
- Sucker -> Mechanical damage -> Inflammation -> **[[Periductal Fibrosis]]** -> Chronic -> **[[Cholangiocarcinoma]]** -> Metastasis
- Immune reponds -> Free radical + [[Nitrosamine]] -> **DNA damage**
- [[Biliary Obstruction]] -> [[Gallbladder Hydrops]]

## Carcinogenicity
Based on [[IARC Monogram]], *O. viverini* is **Group I Carcinogen** -> [[Cholangiocarcinoma]] (x5 OR)
> Note that *O. viverini* infection rate in Thailand decrease dramatically in the last 30 years but liver CA incident has not decrease with it

# Clinical Manifestation
- Light infection -> **Mostly asymptiomatic** or non-specific symptom
- Heavy infection
	- [[Indigestion]] -> **[[Bloating]]**
	- [[Anorexia]] and [[Malabsorption]] -> **[[Fatigue]]**
	- **[[Hepatomegaly]]** -> Rt. upper q. **[[Abdominal Pain]]** 
- Severe infection
	- [[Biliary Obstruction]] -> [[Jaundice]]
	- [[Cirrhosis]]
	- [[Cholangitis]]
	- [[Cholangiocarcinoma]] (Chronic; < 20 years)

# Diagnosis
- **Egg/adult detection in faeces** 
	- Direct simple smear
	- Concentration technique
		- **[[FECT]]** -- **The best one so far**
		- [[Kato-Katz Technique]] -- thick smear, low sensitivity
- Immunological and molecular techniques
	- **Cross-over Rx**
	- **Persistant Ab detection** -- long after the elimination of the parasite

# Treatment
**[[Praziquantel]]**
- Slow resolution in chronic infection
- May induce adverse effect in acute Tx

# Prevention
- **Health education**
- **Avoid raw fish consumption**
> Poor patient cooperation. Habit and culture.
- Regulary screen for infection q6mo.
- Tx both infected individual and reservoir host
- Decrease snail hosts
