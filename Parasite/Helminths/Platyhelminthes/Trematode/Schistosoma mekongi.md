Generally very similar to *[[Schistosoma japonicum]]*

# Geographic Distribution
**South-east Asia**

# Life Cycle
- Infective stage -- **free-swimming cercaria** -> penetrate skin

# Pathogenesis
- Tropism to **[[Mesenteric Vein]]** 
- Eggs deposit at [[Liver]], [[Small Intestine]], and [[Lung]] -> granulomatous reaction -> fibrosis ->
	- [[Periportal Fibrosis]]
	- [[Splenomegaly]] and [[Hepatomegaly]]
	- [[Portal Hypertension]]
- Erosion of [[Submucosa]] and [[Villus]] of [[Small Intestine]] ->
	- [[Malabsorption]]
	- [[Anaemia]]
	- [[Failure to Thrive]]
> Maybe [[Large Intestine]] too? idk

# Clinical Manifestation
## Acute
- **[[Katayama Fever]]** <- [[Hypersensitivity]] reaction against migration and egg deposition
	- Present before egg can be detected in the stool
	- **Flu-like** syndrome

## Chronic
> See pathogenesis

# Diagnosis
**Egg detection in stool** -- egg of *S. mekongi* is round, no spine.

# Treatment
**[[Praziquantel]]**

# Prevention
Avoid water contaction in endermic area
