High prevalence in Thailand ~39% and even higher in [[Immunocompromised]] patients.

# Clinical Manifestation
Either **pathogenic**, **commensal** or **opportunistic** -- unclear whether it can cause disease. Pathogenicity depends on subtype.

**ST1** and **ST3** are related to [[Irritable Bowel Syndrome]]

## Pathogenesis
**ST1** and **ST3** -> 
- IgA degradation -> **[[Dysbiosis]]** -> low grade inflammation
- Oxidative damage
- Mucus impairment (incr. permeability, decr. [[Gut Barrier]] function) 

# Morphology
At least 4 forms :
- Granulated form
- **Vacuolated form** -> found in stool examination
- Cyst form
- Amoeboid form

# Live Cycle
Normal faeco-oral route -> water-borne
1. Cyst is ingested 
2. Excystation in small intestine -> trophozoite
3. Replication
4. Encystation in large intestine -> excreted in faeces

# Diagnosis
**Culture** -- gold standard
> Culture in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) and Bacto agar mixture supplemented with 10% horse serum in the presence of thioglycollate.

# Treatment
- [[Emetine]]
- [[Metronidazole]]
- [[Furazolidone]]
- [[Trimethoprim]]
- [[Suldamethoxazole]]
- [[Pentamidine]]
