**The most prevalence intestinal parasitic infection in [[Immunocompromised]] pt.**

- [[Cryptosporidium parvum]] -- the most common

# Life Cycle
1. Oocysts is ingested
2. Excystation in UGI
3. Ungergone regular [[Apicomplexa]] replication
	1. **Thin-walled oocyst** (20%) -> **autoinfection**
	2. **Thick-walled oocyst** -> **excrete via faeces**

# Clinical Manifestation
## Liver
- [[Triaditis]]
- [[Cholangitis]]
- Lobular [[Hepatitis]] with [[Periductal Fibrosis]] -> sclerosis
- [[Cholangitis]] -> sclerosis

# Pathogenesis
- The parasite hide in the parasitoporous vacuole -> very hard to Tx
- Secretion from [[Apic]]
- Motility -- gliding movement
