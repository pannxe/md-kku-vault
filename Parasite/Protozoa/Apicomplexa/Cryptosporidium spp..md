**The most prevalence intestinal parasitic infection in [[Immunocompromised]] pt.**

- ***[[Cryptosporidium parvum]]*** -- the most common

# Life Cycle
1. Oocysts is ingested
2. Excystation in UGI
3. Ungergone regular [[Apicomplexa]] replication
	1. **Thin-walled oocyst** (20%) -> **autoinfection**
	2. **Thick-walled oocyst** -> **excrete via faeces**

# Clinical Manifestation
## Liver
- [[Triaditis]]
- [[Cholangitis]]
- Lobular [[Hepatitis]] with [[Periductal Fibrosis]] -> sclerosis
- [[Cholangitis]] -> sclerosis

# Pathogenesis
The parasite attaches to the [[Microvillus]] -> epithelial cell release [[Cytokine]] & release of [[Enterotoxin]] -> inflammation -> :
- Apoptosis of [[Enterocyte]] -> [[Malabsorption]] -> [[Malnutrition]] -> [[Weight Loss]] and [[Fatigue]]
- Incr. Cl- secretion and water -> [[Diarrhoea]]
- Parasite hide in the parasitoporous vacuole -> very hard to Tx
- Secretion from [[Apicoplast]]
	- Host attachment
	- Proteases -> cellular invasion
	- gp30 lectin -> motility -> gliding movement

# Clinical Manifestation
Mostly **asymptomatic** in immunocompetent pt. For [[Immunocompromised]] or pt. c. symptom may varries according to [[CD4]] count. Low CD4 -> chronic and life-threatening.
- **Waterry [[Diarrhoea]]** -> **[[Dehydration]]**
- [[Abdominal Discomfort]]
- [[Anorexia]]
- [[Nausea and Vomitting]]
- **[[Malabsorption]]** -> [[Weight Loss]] and [[Fatigue]]
- Respiratory problems

# Diagnosis
**[[Modified Acid Fast Stain]]** -> **4-6 Î¼m.**, **4 sporozotes** inside
> Smaller than [[Cyclospora cayetanensis]], and with sporozote.

# Treatment
- **[[Paramomycin]]** -- target [[Apicoplast]]
- [[Nitazoxanide]]
