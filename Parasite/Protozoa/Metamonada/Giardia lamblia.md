- Zoonotic 
- **Long incubation period ~1-3 wks.**
- **Prepatent period 4-22 days**

[[Giadia enterica]] is also found to be pathogenic in human

# Clinical Manifestation
## Acute giadiasis (< 4 wks.)
- **[[Steatorrhoea]]** and [[Diarrhoea]]
- UGI disconfort -> [[Nausea and Vomitting]], [[Bloating]], [[Abdominal Pain]]
- [[Anorexia]] 
- **Usually self-limited within 3-4 days**

## Chronic giadiasis
- Intermittent [[Steatorrhoea]] and [[Diarrhoea]]
- [[Abdominal Distention]]

# Risk Factor
- Children (**Daycare center** in underdevelop countries) 
- Homosexual
- [[Immunocompromised]] host
- [[Hypoglobulinaemia]] -> Chronic

# Life Cycle
Typical of faecal-oral route
1. **4 nucleus cyst** is ingested
2. Excystation in GI tract
3. Colonization in **duodenum** -> **jejunum**
4. Cyst and trophozoite is excreted in the stool (trophozoite does not survive the environment) 

# Pathogenesis
Pathogenicity depends on strain of the parasite

Trophozoite attaches to the epitherial surface / microvilli using **adhesive disc** -> release of enzymes to degrade musoal layer ->
- **Inhibition of [[Pancreatic Enzymes]]** -> **[[Steatorrhoea]]**
- Irritation -> [[Abdominal Pain]] and [[Nausea and Vomitting]] -> [[Irritable Bowel Syndrome]]
- Parasite induces **chloride hypersecretion**
- -> Apoptosis of epithelial cell and lyphocyte-mediated destruction -> **shortening of villi** -> blunt -> atrophy -> **inflammation of lamina propia** 
-> [[Malabsorption]] (esp. fat soluable vitamin) -> [[Weight Loss]] -> **[[Diarrhoea]]**

Intermittent [[Diarrhoea]] is associated host immunity.

# Complication
## Short-Term
- Electrolyte imbalance
	- [[Hypokalaemia]]
	- [[Hyponatraemia]]
- **[[Dehydration]]**

## Long-Term
Usually stems from [[Malnutrition]] and chronic inflammation.
- [[Allergic Reaction]]
- [[Failure to Thrive]]
- [[Fatigue]] (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome)
- [[Irritable Bowel Syndrome]]
- Etc.

# Diagnosis
- **Cyst and trophozoite and stool** (3 sample in 2 days)
- **[[Enterotest]]** (String Test) <- UGI infection
- Serology
- PCR

## Differential Diagnosis
- [[Viral Infection in GI Tract]] (e.g., [[Norovirus]])
- [[Traveler Diarrhoea]]
- [[Lactose Intolerance]]
- [[Cryptosporidium spp.]] infection
- [[Strongyloides stercolaris]] infection

# Treatment
- **[[Metronidazole]]**
- [[Trimethoprim]]
- [[Tinidazole]]
