a.k.a. **heart attack**

# Pathogenesis
[[Coronary Artery Disease]]
- [[Atherosclerosis]] and [[Atheroma]] rupture
- [[Thrombosis]] and [[Embolism]] -- ← [[Atrial Fibrillation]], [[Endocarditis#Infective]], etc.
- [[Myocardial Vessel Vasospasm]] -- ← [[Platelet Aggregation]]

→ **occusion** or **stenosis** → ↓↓ perfusion → **death** of **[[Cardiac Muscle]]**

> Could be idiopathic

# Pattern

![[Pasted image 20220628170130.png]]

[[Coronary Arteries]] runs on [[Epicardium]] → **subendocardium** is 1st to be ischaemic → spread to outter layer as time progress → **transmural**

**Irreversible** cell injury is within **20-40 min**

## Subendocardial
Limited to **inner 1/3** of [[Heart#Cardiac Wall]] -- many causes, often not totally occluded

→ [[NSTEMI]]

## Transmural
Involve (nearly) **full thickness** -- assoc. **[[Atheroma]] rupture** → (near) **total occlusion**

→ [[STEMI]]

> Not very d stenosis and does not strictly assoc [[Atherosclerosis]]

## Multifocal
Involve only small **intramural vessels** -- assoc. micro-embolism, [[Vasculitis]], or vasospasm
