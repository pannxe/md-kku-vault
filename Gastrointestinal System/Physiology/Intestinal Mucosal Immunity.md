Action of [[Intestinal Mucosal Layer]] in respond to pathogen.

# Characteristics
**Respond to [[Bacterial Infection in GI|Pathogenic bacteria]]** but **NOT to [[Gut Microbiota]] nor food**

## Above the Epithelium
[[Mucus]], [[Antibiotic Drugs]], and secretion [[IgA]]

## Below the Epithelium
[[PRRs]] and [[T-reg Cell]] (esp. [[Th-17]])

There are 2 types of mucosal immunity, **innate** and **adaptive**

# Innate Immunity
## Non-specific Respond
Respond **non-specifically**. 
- **[[Intestinal Barriers]]** -- e.g., [[Tight Junction]] and [[Antimicrobial Peptides]]
- Invasion or infection -> **[[Danger Signals]] -> less-specific responds** 

## Less-specific Respond
Usually via [[Innert Immnue Cells]], i.e., [[Macrophage]], [[Denditic Cell]], and [[ILC]]
- [[Anti-viral State]]
- **Inflammation**
- **Antigen presentation -> adaptive immunity**
> [[Intestinal Epithelium]] has [[PRRs]] on the basolateral surface

# Adaptive Immunity
Respond to **specific** clonal expression
- [[Antibody]] -- esp. **[[IgA]]**
- [[Th Cell]] -- esp. **[[Th-17]]**

---

# Normal Stage
**NO [[Danger Signals]]** -> Ag is safe -> **incr. [[T-reg Cell]] activity** -> [[TGF-β]], [[IL-10]], and [[IL-4]] ->
	- Decr. activity of [[Th-1]], [[Th-2]] -> **decr. inflammation**
	- **Incr. activity of [[B-Cell]]** -> incr. production of [[IgA]] 
> Focus on passive defenses
- [[ILC]] promote [[Intestinal Barriers]]
- [[Plasma Cell]] ([[B-Cell]]) in [[Lamina Propria]] -> **[[IgA]]**
- [[Denditic Cell]] and [[Macrophage]] in the [[Lamina Propria]] -> **inh inflammation** and maintains [[Homeostasis]]
> [[Macrophage]] in [[Lamina Propria]] is mostly [[Macrophage#M2 Macrophage|M2 Mφ]]

# Mechanism
**[[M Cell]] import Ag to [[Peyer Patch]]** ->
- **c [[Danger Signals]]** -> Ag is pathogenic -> **decr [[T-reg Cell]] activity** -> **[[Protective Cell-mediated Intestinal Immune Respond]]
- **[[Denditic Cell]]** presents Ag -> **adaptive respond**
> If there is no [[Danger Signals]] -> Normal Stage

# Clinical Correlation
- Non-pathogenic Ag -> Ag tolerance -> **difficulty making oral vaccine**
- **[[Short-chain Fatty Acids]]** improve all aspect of mucosal immunity
