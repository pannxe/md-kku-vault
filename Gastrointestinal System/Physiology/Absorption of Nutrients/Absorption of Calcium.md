# Method
[[Calcium]] is absorbed by
- **Active transportation** in [[Small Intestine]], esp. **[[Duodenum]]** and **[[Jejunum]]** via [[TRPV6]] â†’ exit via [[PMCA]] and [[Na-Ca Exchanger]]
- Minor : passive -- paracellular
> Similar to [[Reasorption of Calcium (Kidney)]]

# Factors
- Stim. by **[[Vitamin D]]** ([[Calcitriol]]) and **[[PTH]]**
- [[Phosphate]] and [[Oxalatic Acid]] -> bind to Ca -> insoluable salts -> cannot absorb
