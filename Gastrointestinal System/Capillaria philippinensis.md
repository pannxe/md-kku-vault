# Transmission
- **Food-borne**

# Epidermiology
High prevalence in **North-eastern Thailand**

# Morphology
**[[Stichosomal Oesophagus]]** -- half length; GI tract and reproductive organs are in the posterior half

# Life Cycle
**Adult (F1) in [[Jejunum]]** -> **L1 larva** -> autoinfection -> **F2 adult** -> egg -> excrete via faeces

# Transmission
**Eating of uncooked fish** (esp. [[Cyprinid]] fish)

# Pathogenesis
Destroy [[Mucosa layer]] -> inflammation (leukocyte infiltration) -> flatten [[Villus]] and [[Microvillus]] -> hypertrophy of [[Crypt of Lieberkuhn]] -> [[Malabsorption]] (incl. water) -> waterry [[Diarrhoea]] -> [[Dehydration]], and [[Malnutrition]]

# Clinical Manifestation
- **Chronic Waterry [[Diarrhoea]]**
> [[Abdominal Pain]], [[Nausea and Vomitting]], [[Anorexia]], [[Abdominal Discomfort]], large volume of defaecation
- Protein [[Malabsorption]] -> **Protein-losing enteropathy**
	- **[[Hypoalbuminaemia]]** -> [[Pitting Oedema]], [[Ascites]], and [[Cachexia]]
	- Decrease immunity -> 2nd bacterial infection

# Diagnosis
## Clue
- **Chronic [[Diarrhoea]]**
- History of raw freshwater fish consumption
- Cue of [[Malnutrition]]
