# Clinical Manifestation
- **Usually commensal** (90%)
- Invasion of *E. histolytica* causes :
	- [[Amoebic Colitis]] -> [[Amoebic Dysentery]]
	- [[Amoeboma]]
	- Severe -> [[Fulminant Amoebiasis]]
- Faecal-oral transmission -- contaminated water and food 

# Risk Factors
- Poor sanitary
- Immigrant from developing countries
- Travelers to topics
- Residents of institutions for mentally retarded
- Men who have sex with men
- Immunocompromised persons
	- Use of [[Corticosteroid]]
- [[Pregnancy]]
- [[Malnutrition]]
- Young age
- [[Alcoholism]]

# Life cycle
1. Cyst is ingested 
2. Excystation in small intestine -> trophozoite
3. Replication
4. Encystation in large intestine -> excreted in faeces

# Pathogenesis
Trophozoite adhesion using [[Gal/GalNAc Lectin]] -> invation of [[Mucosa layer]] -> colonization -> acute inflammation -> [[Diarrhoea]] and [[Amoebic Dysentery]]

Triphozoites invade [[Lamina Propria]] using [[Amoeba Product]] -> **Flask-shaped ulcer** -> enter portal circulation -> [[Liver Abscess]] and others [[Extraintestinal Amoebiasis]] 

Generally host can establish tolerance by
- Anti-[[Gal/GalNAc Lectin]]-[[IgA]] -> No colonization
- [[Innert Response]] and [[Adaptive Response]]

## Virulence Factors
- [[Amoeba Product]] -> specific binding to epithelial cell and invasion
- Anti-superoxide acitvity <- various surface enzymes (e.g., peroxiredoxin, Superoxide dismutase, etc.)
- Capping & shadding of Ab-Ag complex
- [[Amoebapore-A]] -> forms pore in the target cell
- Induces apoptosis of host cells -> **no WBC in faeces**
