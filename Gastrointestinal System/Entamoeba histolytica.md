- **Usually commensal** (90%)
- Invasion of *E. histolytica* causes :
	- [[Amoebic Dysentery]]
	- [[Amoebic Colitis]]
	- Severe -> [[Fulminant Amoebiasis]]
- Faecal-oral transmission -- contaminated water and food 

# Risk Factors
- Poor sanitary
- Immigrant from developing countries
- Travelers to topics
- Residents of institutions for mentally retarded
- Men who have sex with men
- Immunocompromised persons

# Life cycle
1. Cyst is ingested 
2. Excystation in small intestine -> trophozoite
3. Replication
4. Encystation in large intestine -> excreted in faeces

# Pathogenesis
Trophozoite colonization using [[Gal/GalNAc Lectin]] -> invation of [[Mucosa layer]] -> acute inflammation -> [[Diarrhoea]] and [[Amoebic Dysentery]] -> **Flask-shaped ulcer**

Triphozoite enter portal circulation -> enter [[Liver]] -> Granulomas -> [[Amoebic Liver Abscess]]

Generally host can establish tolerance by
- Anti-[[Gal/GalNAc Lectin]]-[[IgA]] -> No colonization
- [[Innert Response]] and [[Adaptive Response]]

## Virulence Factors
- [[E. histolyical Molecule]] -> specific binding to epithelial cell
- Anti-superoxide acitvity <- various enzymes, Peroxiredoxin, Superoxide dismutase, etc.
- Capping & shadding of Ab-Ag complex
- [[Amoebapore-A]] -> forms pore in the target cell
