Mumps is a viral disease caused by the [[Mumps Virus]].

Initial symptoms are non-specific and include fever, headache, malaise, muscle pain, and loss of appetite. 

These symptoms are usually followed by painful swelling of the [[Parotid Gland]] -> [[Parotitis]], which is the most common symptom of infection.

Symptoms typically occur 16 to 18 days after exposure to the virus and resolve within two weeks. About one third of infections are asymptomatic.
