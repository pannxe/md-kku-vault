**Mostly at [[Parotid Gland]]** (up to 80%) -> [[Submandibular Gland]] -> [[Sublingual Gland]] & [[Salivary Glands#Minor Salivary Glands|Minor Salivary Glands]]

**Risk of malignancy incr c smaller size**
> At **[[Parotid Gland]] mostly benign** -> **[[Sublingual Gland]] mostly malignant**

# Diseases
## Benign
- **[[Pleomorphic Ademona]]** -- most common benign
- **[[Warthin Tumor]]**

## Malignant
- **[[Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma]]** -- most common malignancy
- **[[Carcinoma ex Pleomorphic Ademona]]**

# Pathogenesis
## Bicellular Stem Cell Theory
Every tumors arose from reserved cell from [[Excretory Duct]] and [[Intercalated Duct]]

## Multicellular Theory
Each type has its own specific origin
- [[Excretory Duct]] -> [[Squamous Cell Carcinoma]]
- [[Intercalated Duct]] -> [[Pleomorphic Ademona]]
- [[Striated Duct]] -> [[Oncocytoma]]
- [[Ancinar Cell]] -> [[Ancinar Cell Carcinoma]]

## Associated Factors
- Radiation
- [[Tabacco]] -> [[Warthin Tumor]]

# Clinical Manifestation
**Usually adults female** (EXCEPT [[Warthin Tumor]] -> male > female)

# Diagnosis
**Morphology** -- gross and histopathological evaluation
