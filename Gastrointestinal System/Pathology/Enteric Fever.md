Collective term for [[Typhoid Fever]] and [[Paratyphoid Fever]] caused by [[Salmonella enterica]]

High fetality rate ~20% s tx (~1% c treatment)

# Pathogenesis
Invade [[Peyer Patch]] via [[M Cell]] -> **[[Vi Ag]] (capsule)** + [[LPS]] -> **Anti-phagocytosis** -> can live in vacuole of [[Macrophage]] -> spread to **[[Spleen]]**, [[Liver]] and **[[Bone Marrow]]** -> form biofilm & **reservoir in [[Gallbladder]]** -> persistant infection and [[Cholecystitis]]

# Clinical Manifestation
- [[Bradycardia]] and [[Leukopenia]]
- **Gradually increasing [[Fever]]** (1st wk.)
- **NO DIARRHOEA**, rather **[[Constipation]]** (2nd wk.)
- **[[Rash]]** esp. at [[Abdomen]] (rose spot; 2nd wk.)
- **[[GI Bleeding]]**, **[[Hepatomegaly]]**, and **[[Splenomegaly]]** (~ 3rd week)

> [[Abdominal Pain]], [[Headache]], and mild [[Nausea & Vomiting]] are possible as well.

# Complication
3rd wk. s Tx
- **[[Septicaemia]]** -> **[[Septic Shock]]**
- **[[Intestinal Perforation]]**
- [[Hepatitis]]
- [[Cholecystitis]]

# Diagnosis
- **[[Haemoculture]]**
- [[Widal Test]] -- not widely used 

# Treatment
**[[Ciprofloxacin]]** or [[Ceftriaxone]]; unlike [[Non-typhoidal Salmonellosis]], [[Salmonella enterica Typhi]] does not usually develop resistance
