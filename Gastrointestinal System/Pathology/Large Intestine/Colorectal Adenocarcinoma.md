# Pathogenesis
Progression from [[Adenomatous Polyposis]] or [[Serrated Polyp]]
- **Uncontrolled [[APC gene]]/[[Î²-Catenin]] pathway** ([[Wnt pathway]]) -> uncontrolled mitosis
- **Impaired [[MMR System]]** -> [[Microsatellite Instability]] -> mutation

-> c some additional mutations (e.g., [[p53 gene]]) and reacitvation of [[Telomerase]] -> malignancy

# Pathology
- Chalky necrosis and debries
- Ulcers 
- Hyperchromatism

# Sequelae
**Metastasis** -> [[Lymph Node]] -> other organs
> Stage T4 = invade [[Peritoneum]] and other organs
