# Risk Factor
- Mainly **young famale**

# Pathogenesis
**Mutation of [[CTNNB1]]** -> disrupted [[Î²-Catenin]] -> disrupted cell adhesion and gene transcription -> **Hyperactivation of [[Wnt pathway]]** signaling

# Histology
- **Well-circumscribed malignant neoplasm** -> very low grade
- Has both cystic and solid components & poorly cohesive
- **Filled c haemorrhagic debris**

# Treatment 
**Surgical removal** -> almost no recurrent
