Action of [[Intestinal Mucosal Layer]] in respond to pathogen.

# Characteristics
**Respond to [[Bacterial Infection in GI|Pathogenic bacteria]]** but **NOT to [[Gut Microbiota]] nor food**

## Above the Epithelium
[[Mucus]], [[Antibiotic Agent]], and secretion [[IgA]]

## Below the Epithelium
[[PRRs]] and [[T-reg Cell]] (esp. [[Th-17]])

There are 2 types of mucosal immunity, **innate** and **adaptive**

# Innate Immunity
## Non-specific Respond
Respond **non-specifically**. 
- **[[Intestinal Barriers]]** -- e.g., [[Tight Junction]] and [[Antimicrobial Peptides]]
- Invasion or infection -> [[Danger Signals]]

## Less-specific Respond
Usually via [[Innert Immnue Cells]], i.e., [[Macrophage]], [[Denditic Cell]], and [[ILC]]
- **[[Intestinal Innate Immnue Respond]]**
- [[Anti-viral State]]

# Adaptive Immunity
Respond to **specific** clonal expression
- [[Antibody]] -- esp. **[[IgA]]**
- Controlled inflammation
- Cell-mediated cytotoxicity to infected cells

## Mechanism
**[[M Cell]] import Ag to [[Peyer Patch]]** ->
- **s [[Danger Signals]]** -> Ag is safe -> **incr. [[T-reg Cell]] activity** -> no immune respond
- **c [[Danger Signals]]** -> Ag is pathogenic -> **decr [[T-reg Cell]] activity** -> **incr. [[T-helper Cell]] activity** -> recruite **[[Neutrophil]]** -> **Protective cell-mediated immune respond**
