Secretion from epitheliuma, [[Goblet Cell]], and other glands → **viscous fluid layer overlying [[Respiratory Epithelium]]** containing :
- **[[Mucin]]**, water, ions -- viscous and can trap small particles
- **[[IgA]]** and **[[Lysozyme]]** -- protection against pathogen
- Others 

q particle trapped → cillia escalate them up 

Also, there's **[[MALT]]** to aid defense mechanism, [[Denditic Cell]] sampling antigen in the lumen of [[Respiratoy Tract]], etc.
