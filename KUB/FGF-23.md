## Inhibition
**[[Hypophosphataemia]]** → **↓ production** → ↑ [[Calcitriol]] → ↑ [[Phosphate]] and vise versa

# Functions
**↓ Plasma [[Phosphate]]** level ←
- (directily) **↓ [[Phosphate Reabsorption]]**
-  activation of [[Vitamin D]] → ↓ [[Calcitriol]] → ↑ [[PTH]] → 
	- **↓ [[Absorption of Phosphate]]**
	- **↓ [[Phosphate Reabsorption]]** (indirect)
