# Structure
1x **subunit A** surrounded by 5x **subunit B**

# Mechanism of Action
**Subunit B** bind to **[[Ganglioside Receptor]]** on host cell -> endocytosis -> release of subunit A -> **subunit A incr. [[Adenylate Cyclase]] activity** -> **incr. cAMP** -> **incr. secretion** -> loss of water and electrolyte -> **[[Diarrhoea]]**
