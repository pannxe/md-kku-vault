a.k.a. **Prolactin**

# Forms
Many forms present in blood circulation
- **Free PRL** -- monomer; **active**
- **Big PRL** -- dimer; inactive
- **Big-big PRL** -- c [[IgA]], [[IgA]], or aggregated; inactive

# Regulation

## Stimulation
- **[[TRH]]**
- **[[Oestrogen]]** ← [[Pregnancy]]
> CC : [[Hypothyroidism]] → ↑ TRH → [[Hyperprolactinaemia]]

The specific releasing factor of PRL is still unknown
> While many prolactin stimulating and enhancing factors are well known (such as [[TRH]], [[Oxytocin]], Vasoactive intestinal peptide and [[Oestrogen]]) those have primary functions other than stimulating prolactin release and the search for hypothetical releasing factor or factors continues

## Inhibition
**[[Dopamine]]**
> CC : 
> - [[Breast Feeding]] → ↓ dopamine → positive feedback
> - [[Anti-psychotic Drug]] → [[Hyperprolactinaemia]]
## Clearance
Via **[[Kidney]]**
> CC : [[Renal Insufficiency]] and [[Renal Failure]] → [[Hyperprolactinaemia]]

# Physiology
- **↓ [[GnRH]]** → ↓ [[FSH]] and ↓ [[LH]]
- **[[Breast]]** -- along c [[Oestrogen]] and [[Progesterone]] → differentiation, proliferation and branching of duct, ↑ [[Lactogenic Enzyme]], etc.
- **↑ [[β Cell]] mass** → [[Glucose Regulation]]
- **↑ secretion** of **[[DHEA]]**, **[[Cortisol]]**, and **[[Aldosterone]]** (→ [[Na-Water Retention]])
- Differentiation and proliferation of [[Neuronal Stem Cells]]
- Act on [[Immune System]] #TODO (how?)

# Pathology
- Excess → **[[Hyperprolactinaemia]]**
- Deficiency → **[[Prolactin Deficiency]]**
