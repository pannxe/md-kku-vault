Lesion at **tunica intima** ([[Atheroma]], atheromatous plaque) → **impinge into lumen**; q rupture → **[[Thrombosis]]**

# Risk Factors

![[Pasted image 20220627220335.png]]

## Non-modifiable
- Genetic and familial Hx
- ↑ age
- Male

## Modifiable
Target of prevention
- [[Diabete Mellitus]] and [[Dyslipidaemia]]
- [[Hypertension]]
- [[Inflammation]]
- [[Tabacco]]

# Pathogenesis

![[Pasted image 20220627221520.png]]

According to **respond-to-injury hypothesis** :

- Shear stress from [[Haemodynamic]]
- Immune complex deposition
- [[Radiation]], chemical, and toxins

→ chronic [[Inflammation]] → **[[Endothelial Dysfunction]]** → 
- Adhesion of [[Monocytes]] and [[Platelet]] → **落 [[Macrophage]]** → 
	- Accumulation of [[Lipids]]
	- [[T Cells]] recuitement
	- Mφ engulf lipid → [[Foam Cell]] → altered metabolism → apoptosis
- Recruitment of [[Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell]] → ↑↑ proliferation → ↑↑ [[Collagen]] and [[ECM]] synthesis -- turn fatty steak into plaque

→ Transform into necrotic debris 

---

Another hypothesis is that subendothelial acculumation of [[Cholesterol]] ([[LDL]]) 落 the monocyte; however still similar pathophysiology 

That is bc, dominant lipids in atheroma are **[[Cholesterol]]** and **[[Cholesterol Esters]]** → [[Dyslipidaemia]] ↑↑ risk or rate of atherosclerosis; ⊢ [[Drugs Used in Dyslipidaemia]]

> e.g.,
> - [[Hyperlipoproteinaemia]] -- genetic diseases
> - [[Hypercholesterolaemia]] -- genetic, [[Diabete Mellitus]], [[Hypothyroidism]], etc.

Accumulation of cholesterol crystal and [[Free Fatty Acid]] can 落 [[Inflammation]]

# Morphology
## Fatty Streak

**Early stage** -- lipid core has been formed; not-pathogenic yet

Note Μφ q transform → [[Foam Cell]]

## Plaque

(Mild)

![[Pasted image 20220627223705.png]]
(Severe)

Histological features
- **Fibrous cap** (F) -- facing lumen (L); blue stain is [[Collagen]]; inflammatory cells, neovascularization and calcification might be seen 
- **Necrotic core** (C) -- cholesterol and stuff

# Consequences

![[Pasted image 20220628164601.png]]

Assoc. plaque :
- **Stable plaque** -- ↓ inflammation, thicc ass fibrous cap → ↓↓ risk of rupture 
- **Unstable plaque** -- ↑ inflammation, thin cap → **↑↑ risk of rupture**

> Stable plaque is more of a **stenosis** q rupture

**Rupture** → **[[Thrombosis]]** or **Stenosis**
- **[[Myocardial Infarction]]**
- **[[Stroke]]**

> Also : [[Coronary Artery Disease]], [[Angina Pectoris]], [[Chronic Kidney Disease]], etc.

**Weakening structure** →
- [[Aneurysms]], esp. [[Aortic Aneurysm]]
- Peripheral vascular disease (e.g., [[Gangrene]] of [[Legs]])
