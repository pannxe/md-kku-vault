A sheet of cell that line the inside of [[Blood Vessels]]

# Function
- Maintain permeability → control [[Microcirculation]]
- Regulate [[Blood Coagulation]]

# Physiology
## Basal State
q normal physiological event
- Laminar flow of [[Blood]]
- Normotention
- [[VEGF]]

→ non-adhesive, non-thrombogenic surface

## Activated State
Turbulent flow, [[Hypertension]], [[Cytokines]], [[Compliment System]], [[Hypoxia]], etc.

→ **↑↑ stress** → **↑↑ expression of [[Proinflammatory Cytokines]], [[Coagulation Factors]], etc.** → ↑↑ [[Thrombosis]]
