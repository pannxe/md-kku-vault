**Nitrix Oxide**

# Characteristic
- Unstable radical → **short-lived**
- Small molecule and lipid-soluble → **diffuse thru membrane**

# Biosynthesis
- From **[[Arginine]]** by **[[NO Synthase]]** (using guanidium nitrogen)
- Diffuse to cytoplasm and act on [[NO Receptor]] -> act on [[Guanylyl Cyclase]] -> **↑ [[cGMP]]** -> **↓ cytosolic Ca2+** -> Vasodilation, etc.
