- **G Protein-couple Receptors**
- 3 subunits α, β, and γ
- [[Hormones]] can both ↑ and ↓ activity of GPCR

# Types
Different α Subunit → different 2o pathway
- **[[Gs α-subunit]]** → **↑ cAMP**
- **[[Gi α-subunit]]** → **↓ cAMP**
- **[[Gq α-subunit]]** → **↑ [[DAG]], [[IP3]], and [[Calcium]]**

# MoA
- At rest GDP is binded to α → no effect
- Ligand bind to GPCR → **GDP is replaced by GTP** → **α-GTP dissociates** → **activation of 2o messenger** (differs d types of α-subunit)
- GTPase → (α-GTP → α-GDP) → recombind c βγ → resting stage

# Terminaltion of Signal
- GTPase -- α-GTP → α-GDP
- Dissociation of ligand
- Removal of 2o messenger
- Dephosphorylation of active proteins
