# Clinical Manifestation
- **Usually commensal** (90%)
- Invasion of *E. histolytica* causes :
	- [[Amoebic Colitis]] -> [[Amoebic Dysentery]]
	- [[Amoeboma]]
	- Severe -> [[Fulminant Amoebiasis]]

# Risk Factors
- Poor sanitary
- Immigrant from developing countries
- Travelers to topics -> [[Traveler Diarrhoea]]
- Residents of institutions for mentally retarded
- [[MSM]]
- [[Immunocompromised]] persons
	- Use of [[Corticosteroid]]
- [[Pregnancy]]
- [[Malnutrition]]
- Young age
- [[Alcoholism]]

# Life cycle
**Faecal-oral transmission** -- contaminated water and food 
1. Cyst is ingested 
2. Excystation in small intestine -> trophozoite
3. Replication
4. Encystation in large intestine -> excreted in [[Faeces]]

# Pathogenesis
Trophozoite adhesion using [[Gal/GalNAc Lectin]] -> invation of [[Intestinal Mucosal Layer]] -> colonization -> acute inflammation -> [[Diarrhoea]] and [[Amoebic Dysentery]]

Triphozoites invade [[Lamina Propria]] using [[Amoeba Product]] -> **Flask-shaped ulcer** -> enter portal circulation -> [[Liver Abscess]] and others [[Extraintestinal Amoebiasis]] 

Generally host can establish tolerance by
- Anti-[[Gal/GalNAc Lectin]]-[[IgA]] -> No colonization
- [[Innert Response]] and [[Adaptive Response]]

## Virulence Factors
- [[Amoeba Product]] -> specific binding to epithelial cell and invasion
- Anti-superoxide acitvity <- various surface enzymes (e.g., peroxiredoxin, Superoxide dismutase, etc.)
- Capping & shadding of Ab-Ag complex
- [[Amoebapore-A]] -> forms pore in the target cell
- Induces apoptosis of host cells -> **no WBC in [[Faeces]]**

# Diagnosis
- **[[Stool Examination]]** - **Simple smear & concentration**
	- Cyst and trophozote in stool
- **[[Diarrhoea#Bloody Diarrhoea|Bloody diarrhoea]]** with **mucous** and **offensive smell**
- Cultivation, serological, and molecuilar techniques are also possible

## False Positive
- Leukocyte misread
- Other non-pathogenic amoeba-like organism
	- [[Entamoeba coli]] -- opeque cytoplasm, more nucleus in cyst form
	- [[Endolimax nana]] -- different nucleus morphology
	- [[Iodamoeba buetschlii]] -- large glycogen mass

## False Negative
- [[Antiprotozoan Drugs]] before Dx
- Soap amd tap water lyse trophozoite
- [[Barium Contrast]]
- Single stool examination or improper maintainance of sample

# Treatment
Specific drug + supportive treatment + aspirate removal

## Specific drug
Colitis and liver abscess :
- **[[Metronidazole]]**
- [[Tinidazole]]

Lumenal infection
- **[[Paramomycin]]**
- [[Iodoquinol]]

# Prevention
- Environmental sanitation
- Boiling or filtration of water
- Avoid risks
