# Life Cycle
- Typical of [[Apicomplexa]]
- **Immature oocyst** excreted in the faeces -> take sometimes (1-2 wks.) to mature in the environment -> **no-risk of infection in short-term contact**

# Diagnosis
**[[Modified Acid Fast Stain]]** -> **8-12 Î¼m.**, usually **unsporulated oocyst**
> Larger than those of [[Cryptosporidium spp.]], and without sporozoites. <- immature oocyst

# Treatment
[[Trimethoprim]] / [[Sulfamethoxazole]]
