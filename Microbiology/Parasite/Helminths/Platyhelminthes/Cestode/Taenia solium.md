# Epidemiology
Latin America, Eastern Europe, Sub-saharan Africa, Asia and India

# Life Cycle
- Typical of Taenia spp.
- IH is **[[Pigs]]** -> Oncosphere in muscle -> ingested -> hatch and mature in **[[Small Intestine]]**

# Morphology
- **< 15 uterine branch** 
- **Rostellum and hook** at scolex
> See [[Taenia saginata]] and [[Taenia asiatica]]

# Pathogenesis and Clinical Manifestation
## Adult
Inhabits [[Small Intestine]] -> usually **mild**, **non-specific**, or **asymptomatic**
- [[Abdominal Pain]]
- [[Nausea & Vomiting]]
- [[Diarrhoea]]
- [[Constipation]]

## Cysticercus
If egg is ingested by human -> hatch in [[Small Intestine]] -> larva enters blood stream -> **s** -> **[[Cysticercosis]]** ([[Cysticercus cellulocae]])

# Diagnosis
- **Stool Examination** <- [[FECT]] -- identical egg morphology to [[Taenia saginata]] and [[Taenia asiatica]]
> Need [[Proglottid]] or [[Scolex]] to definitively Dx
- Serological and molecular for species indentification

# Treatment
- **[[Praziquantel]]**
- **[[Albendazole]]**
- [[Niclosamide]] 

Drugs may cause [[Nausea & Vomiting]] -> **[[Reverse Peristalsis]]** -> **[[Cysticercosis]]**

- Collect stool 3 days after Tx -> search for scolex, or
- Stool re-examination for eggs after 1-3 mo.

# Prevention
- **Cooked meat**
- **Freezing at 10C for 5 days** -> kill cysticercus
- Hygiene
- Improve [[Pigs]] husbandry -> Meat inspection at large scele
