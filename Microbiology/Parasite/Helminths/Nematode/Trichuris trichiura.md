# Transmission
- **Soil-borne** -- thus coinfected with [[Ascaris lumbricoides]]

# Life Cycle
1. Ingestion of embyonated egg <- soil, food, and water contaminated with human faeces
2. Adult lives in [[Large Intestine]] -> unembryonated egg in faeces

# Risk Factor
- **Children**
- **[[PICA]]**
> Similar to [[Ascaris lumbricoides]]

# Epidermiology
High prevalence in **Southern Thailand**. High recurrent in the Carribean.
> Moist, warm, sheddy

# Morphology
**Wisp-like** -- thin ant. 3/5, thicc post. 2/5

# Pathogenesis
Inflammation of [[Mucosa layer]] of [[Colon]] ->
- Mucoid and bloody [[Diarrhoea]], [[Rectal Bleeding]] -> iron-deficiency [[Anaemia]] -> **[[Finger Clubbing]]**
- Incr. peristalsis -> [[Tenesmus]] and **[[Rectal Prolapse]]**


# Clinical Manifestation
## Light Infection
- Usually **asymptomatic** or non-specific symptoms
- Inflammation -> mild [[Eosinophilia]] and low-grade [[Fever]]

## Heavy Infection
- Adult -> **Trichuris Dysentery Syndrome**
- Child -> **Massive Infantile Trichuriasis** -> [[Malnutrition]] -> [[Failure to Thrive]]

## The Classical Triad
Rare now
- [[Finger Clubbing]]
- [[Rectal Prolapse]]
- Chronic [[Diarrhoea]] (children)

# Diagnosis
- Classical Triad
- Accidental during [[Colonoscopy]] for [[Abdominal Pain]] and [[Altered Bowel Habits]]
- **Egg in stool** <- [[FECT]], [[Kato-Katz Technique]], simple smear
- [[Charcot-Leyden Crystal]] in faeces is possible
- Molecular and serological test is not commonly used in clinic

# Treatment
- **[[Mebendazole]]**
- [[Albendazole]]
- [[Ivermectin]]

# Prevention
- Safe water, food and hygiene
- Toilet use
- Mass drug administration
