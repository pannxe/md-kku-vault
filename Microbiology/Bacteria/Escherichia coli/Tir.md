Tir (**translocated intimin receptor**) is an essential component in the **adherence** of the **[[EPEC]]** and **[[EHEC]]** to the cells lining the **[[Small Intestine]]**.

Tir is **secreted via** **[[T3SS]]** into the host-cell to act as a receptor for [[Intimin]] on the bacterial surface.

Tir is **encoded by** **[[LEE]]**
