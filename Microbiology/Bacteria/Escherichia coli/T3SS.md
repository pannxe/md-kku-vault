**Type III secretion system** (Injectisome) is a protein appendage found in several Gram-negative bacteria .

In pathogenic bacteria, the needle-like structure is **used as a sensory probe to detect the presence of eukaryotic organisms and secrete proteins that help the bacteria infect them**. The secreted effector proteins are secreted directly from the bacterial cell into the eukaryotic (host) cell, where they exert a number of effects that **help the pathogen to survive and to escape an immune response**.
