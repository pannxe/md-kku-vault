- **Pre-formed**, **Heat-stable** toxin
- **Short onset** -- **1-6 hrs.**
- **Require very small amount** to cause intoxication (in ng-Î¼g range)

# Contamination
Partially processed **high protein** food -> act as growth media for [[Staphylococcus aureus]] -> produce toxin -> re-cooking does not destroy the toxin
- Meats
- Egg
- Diary Products

# Pathogenesis
**[[Super Antigen]]** -> [[Cytokine Storm]] and [[Toxic Shock Syndrome]]

# Clinical Manifestation
Usually self-limited in **3 days**
> Longer than [[Bacillus Enterotoxin]]
- **[[Nausea & Vomiting]]**
- **[[Abdoninal Cramp]]** and **[[Abdominal Pain]]**
- c or s [[Diarrhoea]]

# Diagnosis
- Ag detection -> [[ELISA]]
- [[PCR]]

# Treatment
Not require. [[ORS]] in severe case

# Prevention
- Keep food in safe tempurature range (4-7 C and 62-71 C)
- Food handlers must stop working -> prevent contamination
- Hygiene and protection
