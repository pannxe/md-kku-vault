Shiga toxin is specifically from [[Shigella dysenteriae]]. Others are considered **Shiga-like toxin** (now obsoleted). They are however groupped together as shiga toxins.

# Pathogenesis
Toxin **alters formation of [[Enterocyte]]** or **Epitherial Linning of Blood Vessel** -> bacterial uptake -> toxin **inh. 60S [[rRNA]]** -> **inh. protein synthesis** -> breakdown of linning -> [[Bloody Diarrhoea]]
