# Pathogenesis
Complication from [[Streptococcus spp.]] infection ([[Pharyngotonsilitis]]) → **[[M Protein]]**
- **落 auto-reactive [[B-Cell]]** → ↑↑ [[autoAbs]] → 落 [[Compliment System]] and recruitement of [[Monocytes]] and [[Neutrophil]]
- **落 [[CD4 T-Cell]]** → ↑↑ [[Cytokines]] → **落 [[Macrophage]]**

→ **damage to varies tissues** (complicate to **[[Rheumatic Heart Disease]]**)

# Risk Factors
- Overcrowding and low socioeconomic status
- Poor hygiene
- **Delayed medical Tx**
- Genetic suspectibilty

# Management
- Antibiotics -- **[[Amoxicillin]]**
- Anti-inflammatory -- **[[NSAIDs]]** and [[Steroid]]
- Supportive -- Rest and [[Paracetamol]]

> 2-ndary prevention for recurrent attack with [[Penicillin G]] is neces. for pt. c -carditis, [[Heart Valves]] involvement, etc.
