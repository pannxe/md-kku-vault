# Function
- Drain excess [[Interstitial Fluid]] back to circulation
- Transport [[Lipids]] and [[Fat-soluble Vitamins]] to [[Blood]]
- Facillitate [[Immune System]]

> Fluid in lymphatic system is called [[Lymph]]

# Flow
## Direction
[[Lymphatic Capillaries]] (close-ended tubes) → [[Lymphatic Vessels]] → [[Lymph Node]] → another vessels → finally drain into veins
- Lymph from **top-right** of the body → **[[Right Lymphatic Duct]]** → [[Right Subclavian Vein]]
- The rest → **[[Thoracic Duct]]** → [[Left Subclavian Vein]]

## Rate Control
Normally ~ 100 mL/hr
- **[[Hydrostatic Pressure|P]] of [[Interstitial Fluid]]** -- directly proportional
- **[[Lymphatic Pump]]**
