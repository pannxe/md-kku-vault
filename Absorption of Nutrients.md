Process of moving nutrients from [[GI Tract]] -> [[Blood]]
- [[Villus]]
- [[Microvillus]] -> [[Brush Border]]
-> incr. **rate of absorption** and **[[Digestion of Nutrients]]**

[[Lipids]] -> **[[Central Lacteal]]**
[[Proteins]] and [[Carbohydrates]] -> **artery**

---

# Absorption of [[Carbohydrates]]
- [[Glucose]] and [[Galactose]] -> **[[SGLT1]]** (active absorption) 
- [[Fructose]] -> **[[GLUT5]]** (facilitated diffusion)
-> [[Enterocyte]] -> **[[GLUT2]]** (facilitated diffusion) -> [[Blood]] via vessels in [[Villus]]

> CC : [[Dietary Fiber]] -> [[Probiotics]]

# Absorption of [[Proteins]]
- **[[Amino Acids]]** -> **co-transport c Na+**
- [[Dipeptide]] and [[Tripeptide]] -> **co-transport c H+**
- In children -- **endocytosis of small peptide** (during breast-feeding)
-> **diffuse to [[Blood]]** via vessels in [[Villus]]
> CC : [[BCAAs]] -> postitive health effects

# Absorption of [[Lipids]]
- **[[Monoglycerides]]** and **[[Fatty Acids]]** -> exit [[Micelles]] -> **diffuse** into [[Enterocyte]]
- **[[Cholesterol]]** -> enter cell via **transportors**
> Minor : [[Short-chain Fatty Acids]] can be absorbed in [[Stomach]] -> [[Blood]]

-> both together forms **[[chylomicros]]** -> **diffuse** to [[Central Lacteal]] -> **[[Lymphatic System]]**
> Brings [[Fat-soluble Vitamins]] c it
