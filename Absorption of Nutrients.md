Process of moving nutrients from [[GI Tract]] -> [[Blood]]
- [[Villus]]
- [[Microvillus]] -> [[Brush Border]]
-> incr. **rate of absorption** and **[[Digestion of Nutrients]]**

[[Lipids]] -> **[[Central Lacteal]]**
[[Proteins]] and [[Carbohydrates]] -> **artery**

# Absorption of [[Carbohydrates]]
- [[Glucose]] and [[Galactose]] -> **[[SGLT1]]** (active absorption) 
- [[Fructose]] -> **[[GLUT5]]** (facilitated diffusion)
-> [[Enterocyte]] -> **[[GLUT2]]** (facilitated diffusion) -> [[Blood]]

> CC : [[Dietary Fiber]] -> [[Probiotics]]

# Absorption of [[Proteins]]
