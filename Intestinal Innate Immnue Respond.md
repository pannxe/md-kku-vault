[[Intestinal Epithelium]] has [[PRRs]] on the basolateral surface

- **[[ILC]]** in [[Intestinal Mucosal Layer]] -> **promote [[Intestinal Barriers]]** and responds to infection
- [[Denditic Cell]] and [[Macrophage]] in the [[Lamina Propria]] -> **inh inflammation** and maintains [[Homeostasis]]
> [[Macrophage]] in [[Lamina Propria]] is mostly [[Macrophage#M2 Macrophage|M2 Mφ]]

# Responds
## Intracellular Pathogens
> See [[Viral Infection in GI]] 

[[Intestinal Epithelium]] -> [[Danger Signals]] -> **altered [[PRRs]]** -> activate [[Denditic Cell]] -> [[IL-12]] -> **activate [[ILC-1]]** -> **[[IFN-γ]]** -> recruitement of **[[Macrophage]]** and [[Monocyte]]

## Helminths
> See [[Helminthic Infection in GI]]

[[Tuft Cell]] -> [[IL-25]] and [[IL-33]] -> **activation of [[ILC-2]]** -> **[[IL-5]]** -> recruitement of **[[Eosinophil]]** 

## Extracellular Pathogens and Fungi
> See [[Protozoan Infection in GI]] and [[Bacterial Infection in GI]]

Invasion and altered [[PRRs]] -> [[Denditic Cell]] -> [[IL-23]] -> **activation of [[ILC-3]]** -> 
- **[[IL-17]]** -> recruitement of **[[Neutrophil]]**
- [[IL-22]] -> **[[Paneth Cell]]** -> [[Antimicrobial Peptides]]
