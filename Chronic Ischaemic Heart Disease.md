a.k.a. ischaemic cardiomyopathy (not the same but clinically used interchangably)

# Pathogenesis
**[[Coronary Artery Disease]]** → (prolonged) → 
- Scarring
- [[Ventricular Hypertrophy]] and [[Cardiac Dilation]] → ↑ [[ESV]] → ↓ [[Cardiac Output]]

→ **[[Heart Failure]]**

# Diagnosis
**Slow onset [[Heart Failure]]** in pt c hx of **[[Myocardial Infarction]]** or **[[Angina Pectoris]]**

However, infartion in some pt might be totally silent → CIHD is the 1st sign

# Morphology
- ↑ [[ESV]] → **[[Ventricular Hypertrophy#Left]]** and **[[Cardiac Dilation]]** 
- Scars of healed infarction
- [[Atherosclerosis]] in [[Blood Vessels]]
