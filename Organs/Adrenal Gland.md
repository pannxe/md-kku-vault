[[Retroperitoneum]] c partial [[Peritoneum]] covering. Located above [[Kidney]] of both size. Rt. is pyramidal-shaped. Lt. is semi-lunarish → appears Δ in CT scan.

There are main 3 layers: capsule, cortex, and medulla.
- **Capsule** -- collagenous CNT
- **[[Adrenal Cortex]]** -- outter, brighter
- **[[Adrenal Medulla]]** -- deeper, darker

# Development
Development starts in GA 6 wks
- **Cortex** ← [[Mesoderm]]
- **Medulla** ← [[Neural Crest]] ← [[Ectoderm]]; i.e., modified [[Sympathetic NS]]

Adrenal gland gets smaller c age

## Artery
- **[[Superior Adrenal Artery]]** ← [[Inferior Phrenic Artery]]
- **[[Middle Adrenal Artery]]** ← [[Abdominal Aorta]]
- **[[Inferior Adrenal Artery]]** ← [[Renal Artery]]

## Vein
Along c blood are hormones
- **[[Right Adrenal Vein]]** → [[Inferior Vena Cava]]
- **[[Left Adrenal Vein]]** → [[Left Renal Vein]]

## Lymph
Mainly [[Lateral Aortic Lymph Nodes]] which can make tumor metastasize easily.

# Nerve Supply
[[Sympathetic NS]] : [[Splanchic Nerve]] → medulla
