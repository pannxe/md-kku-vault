**↓ [[Bone]] mass** but normal composition

# Causes
**Aging** esp. [[Menopause]] → **↓↓ [[Oestrogen]]** → ↑ [[IL-6]] → **↑ [[RANK-L]] expression** and **↓ [[OPG]]** → **↑ [[Bone Remodeling#Resorption]]**

Other causes includes :
- Drugs -- **[[Corticosteroid Drugs]]** and **[[Synthetic Thyroid Hormones]]** (and [[Alcohol]])
- Diseases -- [[Multiple Myeloma]]
- Immobilization
- **Endocrine** -- [[Hypogonadism]] in female (like menopause), [[Hypercortisolism]], [[Hyperthyroidism]], [[Hyperparathyroidism]] → imbalanced [[Bone Remodeling]]
- Disorders of [[GI Tract]] -- [[Malabsorption]], [[Malnutrition]], and [[Gastrectomy]]

→ ultimately cause **[[Sex Hormones]] deficiency**

# Clinical Manifestation
**[[Bone Fracture]]** and **[[Bone Deformity]]** -- esp. at [[Spine]], [[Hip]], and [[Wrist]]

In male : [[Testosterone]] can be converted to [[Oestrogen]] → preservation of [[Bone]]

# Diagnosis
Using [[DXA]] to measure **Bone Mineral Density** → **T-score = -2.5 or ↓**

# Prevention
- **[[Exercise]]** -- **weight bearing** and **muscle strength**
- Adequate dietary [[Calcium]] and [[Vitamin D]]
-  [[Tabacco]] and [[Alcohol]]
- [[Anti-resorptive Agents]]

> [[Oestrogen]] replacement as indicated (not for every menopaused female ← ↑ risk of [[Breast Cancer]] and [[Endometrium Cancer]])
